","Kobe, Japan",Concrete,Spatial sequence,religious,Chapel on Mt. Rokko,Contemporary,"This small chapel located on Mount Rokko, near Kobe, completes the trilogy of Christian religious structures designed by Tadao Ando in the mid-1980s. While not enjoying the same reputation as the Church on the water or the Church of light, the chapel on Mount Rokko becomes a synthesis of its predecessors and underlines the architect's effort to establish a link between religious space and nature.
In this chapel Ando uses the materials of cement, glass and light to create a powerful spiritual place through a rich spatial sequence of light and dark, direct and indirect natural light. His usual architectural vocabulary: simple geometry, meticulously studied and delicate games of light and shadow, as well as the modulated exposed concrete surfaces that interact with metal and glass.
However, this chapel includes western elements such as the bell tower, which plays a formal rather than utilitarian role, becoming a vertical counterpoint to a predominantly horizontal composition.
Unlike the towers of the western church where the bell called parishioners to religious services and other events, in this case the bells are rarely rung, to avoid disturbing the customers of the hotel where the chapel is located.
As in other churches, Ando avoids direct and pompous access to the chapel. Instead, use a 40-meter-long concrete porch, covered with opaque turquoise glass, on which it once stands in steel and glass. This tunnel provides processional access to the chapel, emphasizing the majesty of the approach to marriage.
However, this view of the tunnel does not lead directly to the building or to a monumental access, since the chapel is located on one side of the path. The tunnel frames nature, or in this case the garden.
The next space is a dark hall defined by a curved wall which invites the visitor to enter the chapel establishing a transition between darkness and light, the mundane space and the sacral area.
Subsequently, the space is enlarged to generate the main chapel, a 6.5 m cube on each side where a wall has been replaced by a large window, using the structure to represent the theme of the cross.
In this way Ando reaches virtual contact with nature, through a framed view of the landscape and a sumptuous display of light. The effect is reinforced by the contrast of the colorful garden and the solemn monochromatic room.
A different type of light sharply illuminates the area of ​​the altar through a thin elongated crack located at the intersection of the wall with the roof. This function allows an ever-changing play of light on the rough surface of the concrete, whose appearance changes according to the time of day and day of the year.

",Denmark,Concrete,,Museum,LEGO House,Contemporary,"BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group and LEGO bring the toy scale of the classic LEGO brick to architectural scale with LEGO House, forming vast exhibition spaces and public squares that embody the culture and values at the heart of all LEGO experiences.
Designed by BIG and COWI, LEGO House is an experience hub for LEGO fans of all ages, as well as an architectural landmark and a significant step towards the city’s goal of making Billund the Capital for Children. The construction of the 12,000 m2 LEGO House commenced in 2014, replacing the former City Hall building with support from three generations of the LEGO family and Billund City Mayor Ib Kristensen.
Due to its central location in the heart of Billund, the 23 m tall LEGO House is conceived as an urban space as much as an experience center. 21 overlapping blocks are placed like individual buildings, framing a 2,000 m2 LEGO square that is illuminated through the cracks and gaps between the volumes. The plaza appears like an urban cave without any visible columns and is publicly accessible, allowing visitors and citizens of Billund to shortcut through the building.
The LEGO square is energized by an urban character, welcoming locals and visitors to the café, restaurant, LEGO store and conference facilities. Above the square, a cluster of galleries overlap to create a continuous sequence of exhibitions. Each gallery is color-coded in LEGO’s primary colors so wayfinding through the exhibitions becomes a journey through the color spectrum.
The first and second floors include four play zones arranged by color and programmed with activities that represent a certain aspect of a child's learning: red is creative, blue is cognitive, green is social, and yellow is emotional. Guests of all ages can have an immersive and interactive experience, express their imagination, and not least be challenged by meeting other builders from all over the world. The top of the building is crowned by the Masterpiece Gallery, a collection of LEGO fans’ beloved creations that pay tribute to the LEGO community.
The Masterpiece Gallery is made of the iconic 2x4 LEGO brick and showcases art beneath eight circular skylights that resemble the studs of the brick. Like the golden ratio, the proportions of the brick are nested in the geometries of everything man-made in the building, from the glazed ceramic tiles in the steps and walls to the overall 21 block scheme. Atop the Masterpiece Gallery, citizens and visitors can get a 360° panoramic view of the city. Some of the rooftops can be accessed via pixelated public staircases that double as informal auditoria for people watching or seating for performances.",2017,6100eb253a671e6970209eb6

This reinvention of Starhill Gallery is designed by Stephen Pimbley, founding director of Spark and the architect behind Singapore’s hugely popular Clarke Quay.
Stephen says, “Unlike many street-facing malls in Kuala Lumpur, our new façade for Starhill Gallery is firmly engaged with the public realm and generates valuable visual connections along this section of Bukit Bintang via the heavy footfall. We have designed a beacon for Starhill Gallery that celebrates its relationship with the city.”
Spark's design has opened up the façade which provides a lot of visual interest via a continuous shop front that wraps the existing building in a crystalline skin of glass and stone panels. The new façade resembles the ""wet drapery"" of the ancient statues of Greece and Rome, and the beautifully crafted gowns on sale inside Starhill Gallery. The fractured variation of solidity and transparency transforms the street façade of the existing building entirely, giving it a new contemporary classic identity that stands out amongst the quick-fix, ubiquitous shopping mall façades of many of Starhill Gallery’s neighbours.

The Academy had been planning the new library for fifteen years but were consistently disappointed with the designs that the hired architects and committee were proposing. The Academy was very particular in knowing the kind of building they wanted: a brick exterior to match the Georgian buildings of the school and an interior with the ideal environment for study. Kahn's sympathetic use of brick and his concerns for natural light met these specific principles that the Academy had in mind for the library, and thus the design fell in his hands.
""The quality of a library, by inspiring a superior faculty and attracting superior students, determines the effectiveness of a school. No longer a mere depository of books and magazines, the modern library becomes a laboratory for research and experimentation, a quiet retreat for study, reading and reflection, the intellectual center of the community.… Fulfilling needs of a school expected eventually to number one thousand students, unpretentious, though in a handsome, inviting contemporary style, such a library would affirm the regard at the Academy for the work of the mind and the hands of man.""
People enter the 111'x111' square library from the ground floor and climb up a grand set of stone stairs to the first floor. Coming up the last step onto the first floor one can immediately perceive the relationship of reference area, circulation desk, and book stacks. Kahn found this aspect to be important so that visitors can easily understand the plan of the building upon their entrance.
With the circulation desk on the first floor instead of the ground floor it is evident that service took priority over security. The Academy accepted this at ease since it allowed librarians to be closer to the bookstacks and the readers, therefore making the most sense when considering the function of a circulation desk in a library.
The beauty in the architecture of the first floor, however, is what gave the Exeter Library its fame. This main floor reaches 70 feet in height and soaks in natural light from a clerestory at the top of this space and from large expanses of glass on the north and west sides. From this 50 foot square space visitors can spot metal bookstacks and readers seven levels above through large holes punctured perfectly into the walls, almost touching at the corners where the walls square off.
The upper floors contain book stacks for 250,000 volumes, a student computer lab, a viewing area for videotapes and DVDs, listening areas for music, offices for use of faculty members, and 210 specially designed study carrels for students. On these floors are approximately 450 different seating types scattered among the building in different rooms, such as some lounges and on a terrace that encircles the building along the exterior of the fourth floor.
Kahn used Exeter brick on the exterior of the nine story building, a material made in Exeter itself and a design factor that was important to the Academy. He also used stone and slate in the interior, and finished certain aspects of the library in natural wood. The wood contrasted the stone by giving the spaces a sense of warmth and a glow that welcomed readers when the natural light flooded upon this natural material.
The Academy was finally content with their new library when it was completed in 1972. Kahn was successful in meeting all of their resquests through his own principles of design. The building is functional and meets the needs of the readers first while still standing as an innovative structure in itself. It is, in Kahn's words, ""the thoughtful making of spaces.""",1972,6100eb253a671e6970209ec3

The$52M, 87,500-square-foot project, made possible through supplemental funding from the Massachusetts State Legislature, is a dynamic space of exchange, collaboration, and experiment. Uniting the university’s departments of Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning, and the Building and Construction Technology program under one roof for the first time, the structure itself is a teaching tool for prescient sustainable design.

The building is organized around a skylit central commons that brings students together for lectures, exhibits, presentations, and informal gatherings. Studios, maker spaces and classrooms surround the central space that opens onto the street as a showcase for the design disciplines. The commons is capped by a green roof that comprises an outdoor learning environment and experimental space for the landscape department.

A demonstration of the construction process itself, columns and beams of glue-laminated wood, a floor of composite, exposed cross laminated timber plank and cast in place concrete, and the lobby’s “zipper truss”  (developed in consultation with Equilibrium Consulting) all exemplify innovative timber engineering. 

The building’s highly-efficient envelope of copper-colored, anodized aluminum panels and vertical windows suggests the colors and patterns of the region’s forests and trees. Surrounding landscaping by Stephen Stimpson Associates makes extensive use of native plants and paving materials. Dedicated mechanical equipment is zoned for optimal efficiency, and extensive glazing and skylights provide maximum daylight to the building’s interior, reducing the need for artificial lighting. Storm water management directs roof runoff to a “spring source” at the top of the site, filtering the water through bio-swales and timber dams to the site’s lower end and back to the Connecticut River.

PTFE",,Airport,Denver Airport,Parametric,"When the City of Denver handed Fentress the project, the airport was behind schedule, over budget and had an unfavorable design. Given a deadline of only three weeks to propose a new concept, Curtis Fentress worked tirelessly to design an innovative solution for Denver’s passenger terminal that was more affordable, faster to build, and most notably, an iconic design. The city wanted a symbol as much as a gateway, a building as visually memorable as it was functional.
Fentress’ design broke through the ceiling of a thirty-five year period in which airports had devolved into “people processors,” with cramped maze-like corridors and dingy fluorescent-lit interiors. The established “warehouse” design approach trended away from passengers’ needs. Having researched airport design for his masters thesis, Curtis Fentress, a protégé of I.M. Pei and the head of his own established firm, vowed to change this trend.
“We took all the mechanicals off the roof,” Fentress says, recalling the process of creating the world’s then-largest and most famous fabric roof. “This freed us to create a superlight cutting-edge structure, a canopy saturated with light. In doing so, it saved the airport thousands of tons of steel, USD$115 million in budget, and reduced the construction schedule by nine months.”
As a pioneer in sustainable design, Fentress set the groundwork for an environmentally responsible airport design. Natural daylight bathes the interior of the terminal via numerous clerestories, curtain-walls (with a low-e coating) and the translucent roof. The roof material allows 10 percent of visible light to pass through the fabric during the day, while it reflects 90 percent of solar radiation in a high-altitude environment, reducing solar heat gain. The canopy drastically reduces the need for indoor lighting during daylight hours, capitalizing on Denver’s 300 days of sunshine per year. Afterwards, the airport installed a “solar farm” with 9,000 panels producing 3.5 million kilowatts of electricity.",1995,6100eb253a671e6970209ea7

Contemporary","The violent insertion of Daniel Libeskind’s Spiral into the Victorian neighborhood of South Kensington renders a cataclysmic disruption into a landscape of order and propriety. It envisions a rupture in the fabric of space and time, aggressively anachronistic from the building it adjoins, unapologetically appealing not to cultured humanism but to the mathematical logic of complexity and chaos. What is now textbook ""Libeskind"" was in 1996 a shocking non-starter for the London establishment, an unacceptable risk for a city perpetually torn between its agitated cosmopolitan energies and its quintessential impulse toward nostalgia and restraint. Nearly twenty years after the Spiral was selected as the winner of a distinguished international competition, this controversial extension proposal for the Victoria and Albert Museum remains unbuilt.

The project's nonfulfillment is perhaps its most enduring legacy, but the design broke ground in other ways. When Libeskind's proposal was released amid great fanfare to the public, it was on the leading edge of a turn toward what Charles Jencks refers to as ""Nonlinear Architecture,"" a ""new shared language of expression ... more in tune with an unfolding, jumping cosmos than the rigid architectures of the past."" Jencks was fascinated by Libeskind's project and held it up as an example of the ""aesthetic of undulating movement"" that he correctly predicted would consume global architecture in the new millennium. The Spiral also coincided with (and partly triggered) the rise of Libeskind's stardom. While prompting the very outcry that felled its realization, its destabilizing audacity sent shock waves through the architecture establishment and attracted a bevy of client-suitors that ensured the architect's future success.

The project begins as a single tectonic strip folded into itself in an upward spiral six layers high. Although the disheveled geometries of the Spiral appear uncontrolled and deconstructed, they are quite the opposite, resulting from a single creative apparatus whose movements are governed by an organized process. As the irregular sequence of trapezoidal and rhomboid walls accelerates upward, the planes collide into each other, creating a series of box-like shapes that interpenetrate and seem to crush the hollows below. Jagged floorplates are inserted into the enclosed volume, stabilized by the presence of a strong vertical core that anchors the turbulent energy swirling around it. The resulting structure is scaleless, governed not by its relationship to the human occupant but by the mathematical principles behind its generation; devoid of its context, it could just as intelligibly be three times larger or the size of an elegant paperweight.

While the folded walls play a powerful formal role, they are also structural. Calculated using advanced digital computational models, forces are channeled through the precipitously angled walls, allowing the interior gallery spaces to remain open and column-free. This feat of engineering, spearheaded by the acclaimed studio of Cecil Balmond, is all the more remarkable given the design's unusual tectonic conditions: unsupported planes running diagonally through space, misaligned with their neighbors, cantilevered at will.

Balmond's other major contribution to the project was his work on the exterior skin. An interlocking pattern of tessellated tiles, each derived from a manipulated golden rectangle, sheathes the exterior surfaces. According to Studio Balmond's website, this ""mathematical mosaic... illustrates the sequential nature of the building's spiral form."" Dancing across the folded walls like pixelated static, these tiles are animated by the same dialectic of chaos and control that pervades the project's entirety. Inspired by the geometry of fractals, they attempt to channel an energy that is cosmic and infinite.

The Spiral’s linguistic and scalar tensions with its surroundings constitute the source of both its conceptual strength and its political weakness. The Victorian and Edwardian architecture of the V&A’s accretions, historicist and eclectic, engages and activates Libeskind's creation. But for the proposal's detractors, this dialogue came at too heavy a cost to the existing landscape, overshadowing if not defacing the older structures. One apoplectic critic famously predicted that the Spiral's confrontational incongruence would leave the museum ""visually raped.""

Despite securing a significant portion of its projected $160 million cost from private donors, the controversial proposal was repeatedly denied public funding. When it was rejected for lottery funds for a third time in 2004, Libeskind's design was finally scrapped. The frustrated architect, whose career had since taken off through major commissions in Berlin and New York, parted ways with the museum shortly thereafter. [4] While he was never able to see his visions fully realized, he was able to reconfigure them last year on a smaller scale for a sculpture in Almeria. In this defanged, lesser iteration, impotent in its pastoral solitude, it becomes clear how critical the urban context was in activating the Spiral's rhetorical polemic and revealing the potency of its cosmic aspirations.",1996,6100eb253a671e6970209ed7

Just like in Japanese architecture, Wright wanted to create harmony between man and nature, and his integration of the house with the waterfall was successful in doing so.
The house was meant to compliment its site while still competing with the drama of the falls and their endless sounds of crashing water. The power of the falls is always felt, not visually but through sound, as the breaking water could constantly be heard throughout the entire house.
The circulation through the house consists of dark, narrow passageways, intended this way so that people experience a feeling of compression when compared to that of expansion the closer they get to the outdoors. The ceilings of the rooms are low, reaching only up to 6'4"" in some places, in order to direct the eye horizontally to look outside. The beauty of these spaces is found in their extensions towards nature, done with long cantilevered terraces. Shooting out at a series of right angles, the terraces add an element of sculpture to the houses aside from their function.
The terraces form a complex, overriding horizontal force with their protrusions that liberated space with their risen planes parallel to the ground.
The house took on ""a definite masonry form"" that related to the site, and for the terraces they decided on a reinforced-concrete structure. It was Wright's first time working with concrete for residences and though at first he did not have much interest in the material, it had the flexibility to be cast into any shape, and when reinforced with steel it gained an extraordinary tensile strength.
The exterior of Fallingwater enforces a strong horizontal pattern with the bricks and long terraces. The windows on the facade have also have a special condition where they open up at the corners, breaking the box of the house and opening it to the vast outdoors.
From its daring cantilevers to its corner window detail and constant sound of the waterfall, Fallingwater is the physical and spiritual occurence of man and architecture in harmony with nature. All you have to do is listen.",1939,6100eb253a671e6970209ea8

",Government,Capitol Complex,Modern,"Taking over from Albert Mayer, Le Corbusier produced a plan for Chandigarh on the foothills of the Himalayas that conformed to the modern city planning principles of Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), in terms of division of urban function, an anthropomorphic plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks, Inherently, the Secretariat building is the largest edifice in the Capitol Complex and is the headquarters of both the Punjab and Haryana governments.
Le Corbusier’s plan for the capitol consisted of four buildings (or “edifices”) and six monuments arranged on a single site, loosely conceptualized as three interlocking squares. Only three of these four buildings were ever realized (the High Court, the Legislative Assembly, and the Secretariat) and were designed to represent the major functions of democracy the fourth building, the Governor’s Palace, was never built.
The building is composed of six eight-story block divided by expansion joints and measures over 800 feet long, bookended by two sculptural ramps providing vertical circulation throughout the facilities’ levels. Completed in 1952, the Secretariat building functions as the headquarters of the Punjab and Haryana municipal governments and is the largest of Corbusier’s three completed administrative buildings. The massive, horizontal complex is comprised of 8 stories of rough-cast concrete. 
The building has notable similarities with Corbusier’s Marseille block and had an equally lofty goal: to revolutionize the modern office building. The Secretariat was among the first buildings designed as a “healthy building” with careful attention paid to natural lighting, ventilation, and organizational efficiency.
The whole structure is constructed in 'beton brut' (rough-cast concrete) with Corbusier's signature 'brise-soleils' facade. Over 800 feet long, the extensive facade of the building gives a sculptural aesthetic with exposed concrete ramps, punctured with small square windows dictating the front and rear views. Accordingly, the Secretariat building avoids overshadowing the Capitol as a whole with its bulk size. Instead, it plays a unifying role in the complex, which is symbolic of its administrative function.
To maximize natural lighting and increase cross-ventilation, a long and narrow plan was implemented by Corbusier , this approach also helped delineate both the actual and the implied borders of the capitol complex as a whole. To visually reduce the scale of its massive facade, the Secretariat was designed with a modular façade that fragments the elevation into legible, programmatic elements. This approach not only prevents onlookers from being overwhelmed by its scale, it also plays an important role with regard to the daylighting scheme of the project as a whole. 
The various projections, recesses, circulation elements, and multi-level interior spaces act as sun-breaks ('brise-soleils') to mitigate solar gain.
The Secretariat is a simpler and more conventional form where variations of structure and internal distribution do not interrupt its compact volume, but are reproduced two-dimensionally in the very elaborate design of the 'brise soleils'. 
The Secretariat and the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) building are in Sector 1 of the complex. Nearby in the sector is a huge open hand sculpture, conceived as a symbol of unit and the colorful High Court, which has a double roof, providing protection from the sun.",1962,6100eb253a671e6970209ea2

",Cultural Center,Heydar Aliyev Centre,Contemporary,"The Heydar Aliyev Center hosts a variety of cultural programs, its design is a departure from the rigid and often monumental architecture of the former Soviet Union that is so prevalent in Baku, aspiring instead to express the sensibilities and diversity of Azeri culture.
The Center's design establishes a continuous, fluid relationship between its surrounding plaza and the building's interior. The plaza, as the ground surface, accessible to all, rises to envelop an equally public interior and define a sequence of event spaces within. Undulations, folds and inflections modify this surface to create an architectural landscape that performs a multitude of functions: welcoming, embracing, and directing visitors throughout the center; blurring the conventional differentiation between architecture and landscape, interior and exterior.
One of the most critical yet challenging elements of the project was the architectural development of the building’s skin. Our ambition to achieve a surface so continuous that it appears homogenous, required a broad range of different functions, construction logics and technical systems had to be brought together and integrated into the building’s envelope. Advanced computing allowed for the continuous control and communication of these complexities among the numerous project participants.
The Heydar Aliyev Center principally consists of two collaborating systems: a concrete structure combined with a space frame system. In order to achieve large-scale column-free spaces that allow the visitor to experience the fluidity of the interior, vertical structural elements are absorbed by the envelope and curtain wall system. The particular surface geometry fosters unconventional structural solutions, such as the introduction of curved ‘boot columns’ to achieve the inverse peel of the surface from the ground to the West of the building, and the ‘dovetail’ tapering of the cantilever beams that support the building envelope to the East of the site.
The space frame system enabled the construction of a free-form structure and saved significant time throughout the construction process, while the substructure was developed to incorporate a flexible relationship between the rigid grid of the space frame and the free-formed exterior cladding seams. These seams were derived from a process of rationalizing the complex geometry, usage, and aesthetics of the project. Glass Fibre Reinforced Concrete (GFRC) and Glass Fibre Reinforced Polyester (GFRP) were chosen as ideal cladding materials, as they allow for the powerful plasticity of the building’s design while responding to very different functional demands related to a variety of situations: plaza, transitional zones and envelope. 
In this architectural composition, if the surface is the music, then the seams between the panels are the rhythm. Numerous studies were carried out on the surface geometry to rationalize the panels while maintaining continuity throughout the building and landscape. The seams promote a greater understanding of the project’s scale. They emphasize the continual transformation and implied motion of its fluid geometry, offering a pragmatic solution to practical construction issues such as manufacturing, handling, transportation and assembly; and answering technical concerns such as accommodating movement due to deflection, external loads, temperature change, seismic activity and wind loading.
To emphasize the continuous relationship between the building’s exterior and interior, the lighting of the Heydar Aliyev Center has been very carefully considered. The lighting design strategy differentiates the day and night reading of the building. During the day, the building’s volume reflects light, constantly altering the Center’s appearance according to the time of day and viewing perspective. The use of semi-reflective glass gives tantalizing glimpses within, arousing curiosity without revealing the fluid trajectory of spaces inside. At night, this character is gradually transformed by means of lighting that washes from the interior onto the exterior surfaces, unfolding the formal composition to reveal its content and maintaining the fluidity between interior and exterior.
As with all of our work, the Heydar Aliyev Center’s design evolved from our investigations and research of the site’s topography and the Center’s role within its broader cultural landscape. By employing these articulate relationships, the design is embedded within this context; unfolding the future cultural possibilities for the nation. ",2013,6100eb253a671e6970209eac

positive-negative balance line",residential,Villa Savoye,International,"Situated in Poissy, a small commune outside of Paris, is one of the most significant contributions to modern architecture in the 20th century, Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier. Completed in 1929, Villa Savoye is a modern take on a French country house that celebrates and reacts to the new machine age.
The house single handedly transformed Le Corbusier’s career as well as the principles of the International Style; becoming one of the most important architectural precedents in the history.  Villa Savoye’s detachment from its physical context lends its design to be contextually integrated into the mechanistic/industrial context of the early 20th century, conceptually defining the house as a mechanized entity.
Le Corbusier is famous for stating, “The house is a machine for living.”  This statement is not simply translated into the design of a human scaled assembly line; rather the design begins to take on innovative qualities and advances found in other fields of industry, in the name of efficiency.
In response to his aspirations and admiration of mechanized design, Le Corbusier established “The Five Points” of architecture, which is simply a list of prescribed elements to be incorporated in design.  The Five Points of architecture can be thought of as Le Corbusier’s modern interpretation of Vitruvius’ Ten Books on Architecture, not literally in the sense of an instructional manual for architects, but rather a checklist of necessary components of design.  So much so that Villa Savoye is thoroughly tailored to Corbusier’s Five Points (Pilotis, Flat Roof Terrace, Open Plan, Ribbon Windows, Free Facade). 
At this point in Le Corbusier’s career, he became intrigued by the technology and design of steamships.  The simplistic, streamlined result born out of innovative engineering techniques and modular design had influenced Corbusier’s spatial planning and minimalistic aesthetic.  
The pilotis that support the decks, the ribbon windows that run alongside the hull, the ramps providing a moment of egress from deck to deck; all of these aspects served as the foundation of the Five Points of Architecture and are found in the overall composition of Villa Savoye.
Upon entering the site, the house appears to be floating above the forested picturesque background supported by slender pilotis that seem to dissolve among the tree line, as the lower level is also painted green to allude to the perception of a floating volume.
The lower level serves as the maintenance and service programs of the house.  One of most interesting aspects of the house is the curved glass façade on the lower level that is formed to match the turning radius of automobiles of 1929 so that when the owner drives underneath the larger volume they can pull into the garage with the ease of a slight turn.
The living quarters, or the upper volume, are fitted with ribbon windows that blend seamlessly into the stark, white façade, which void the façade(s) of any hierarchy.  The ribbon windows begin to play with the perception of interior and exterior, which does not fully become expressed until once inside.
However once inside, there becomes a clear understanding of the spatial interplay between public and private spaces.  Typically, the living spaces of a house are relatively private, closed off, and rather secluded. Yet, Le Corbusier situated the living spaces around a communal, outdoor terrace that is separated from the living area by a sliding glass wall. 
This notion of privatized areas within a larger communal setting is a common thread later on in Le Corbusier’s housing projects.
Both the lower level and the upper living quarters are based off an open plan idea that provokes the inhabitant to continuously meander between spaces.  As an architectural tour de force, Le Corbusier incorporates a series of ramps moving from the lower level all the way to the rooftop garden, which requires the inhabitant to slow down and experience the movement between spaces.
Villa Savoye is a house designed based on the architectural promenade. Its experience is in the movement through the spaces.  It is not until one becomes familiar with the subtle peculiarities that the movement and proportionality of the spaces evokes a sense of monumentality within the Parisian suburb.
Villa Savoye exemplifies proportional plan to section relationships with the sections smaller than the plans, and some but not all of the interior configuration related. 
Structural units adjoin in Villa Savoye. 
Structural fields are disrupted by two different vertical circulation elements in the Villa Savoye. 
In Villa Savoye, the subtraction occurs within a bounded frame. 
Differences between the interior and exterior living spaces establish the positive-negative balance line in Villa Savoye. 
Squares were also used to design the Villa Savoye. 
A four-square is a geometric configuration that is two cells by two cells and has a common central point of contact. The most direct example is the Viking Fortress, Ledoux’s theatre and Villa Savoye.

The Unite d’Habitation in Marseille, France was the first large scale project for the famed architect, Le Corbusier. In 1947, Europe was still feeling the effects of the Second World War, when Le Corbusier was commissioned to design a multi-family residential housing project for the people of Marseille that were dislocated after the bombings on France.

Completed in 1952, the Unite d’ Habitation was the first of a new housing project series for Le Corbusier that focused on communal living for all the inhabitants to shop, play, live, and come together in a “vertical garden city.”
The Unite d’Habitation was a first, both for Le Corbusier and the ways in which to approach such a large complex to accommodate roughly 1,600 residents. Especially since Le Corbusier did not have many buildings of such a substantial scale when compared to the villas. When designing for such a significant number of inhabitants natural instinct is to design horizontally spreading out over the landscape, rather Le Corbusier designed the community that one would encounter in a neighborhood within a mixed use, modernist, residential high rise.  
Le Corbusier’s idea of the “vertical garden city” was based on bringing the villa within a larger volume that allowed for the inhabitants to have their own private spaces, but outside of that private sector they would shop, eat, exercise, and gather together.
With nearly 1,600 residents divided among eighteen floors, the design requires an innovative approach toward spatial organization to accommodate the living spaces, as well as the public, communal spaces. Interestingly enough, the majority of the communal aspects do not occur within the building; rather they are placed on the roof. 
The roof becomes a garden terrace that has a running track, a club, a kindergarten, a gym, and a shallow pool. Beside the roof, there are shops, medical facilities, and even a small hotel distributed throughout the interior of the building. The Unite d’Habitation is essentially a “city within a city” that is spatially, as well as, functionally optimised for the residents.
Unlike Corbusier’s usual employment of a stark, white façade, Unite d’Habitation is constructed from reinforced beton-brut concrete (rough cast concrete), which was the least costly in post-war Europe. However, it could also be interpreted as materialistic implementation aimed at characterizing the conditional state of life after the war - rough, worn, unforgiving.
Even though Unite d’Habitation does not take on the same materialistic qualities as most of Corbusier’s works, there is still a sense of mechanistic influence, in addition to the Five Points developed by Corbusier in the 1920s. For example, the buildings large volume is supported on massive pilotis that allow for circulation, gardens, and gathering spaces below the building; the roof garden/terrace creates the largest communal space within the entire building, and the incorporated patio into the façade system minimizes the perception of the buildings height, as to create an abstract ribbon window that emphasizes the horizontality of such a large building.
Also, it is apparent that Le Corbusier’s mechanized influences from other industries have not been lost in design. As massive as the Unite d’Habitation is, it begins to resemble the steamship that Corbusier is so intrigued with.
The massive volume appears to be floating, the ribbon windows resemble the cabin windows running along the hull, while the roof garden/terrace and sculptural ventilation stacks appear as the top deck and the smoke stacks. Even though that these elements are quite figural and open to interpretation based on perception, there is an inherent connection between the two.
One of the most interesting and important aspects of the Unite d’Habitation is the spatial organization of the residential units. Unlike most housing projects that have a “double-stacked” corridor (a single hallway with units on either side), Le Corbusier designed the units to span from each side of the building, as well as having a double height living space reducing the number of required corridors to one every three floors.
By narrowing the units and allowing for a double height space, Corbusier is capable of efficiently placing more units in the building and creating an interlocking system of residential volumes. At each end of the unit there is a balcony protected by a brise-soleil that allows for cross ventilation throughout the unit flowing through the narrow bedrooms into the double height space; emphasizing an open volume rather than an open plan.
Unite d’Habitation is one of Le Corbusier’s most important projects, as well as one of the most innovative architectural responses to a residential building. So much so, that the Unite d’ Habitation is said to have influenced the Brutalist Style with the use of beton-brut concrete. Unite d’Habitation has since been the example for public housing across the world; however, no venture has been as successful as the Unite d’Habitation simply because the Modular proportions that Corbusier established during the project. Nonetheless, Le Corbusier’s first large scale project has proved to be one of his most significant and inspiring.

Home to the LA Philharmonic, it has received wide acclaim for its excellent acoustics and distinctive architecture. In the decade since its opening, the hall's sweeping, metallic surfaces have become associated with Frank Gehry’s signature style.
In 1987, Lilian Disney donated $50 million to establish a concert hall in honor of her late husband, Walt. Frank Gehry was selected from among several candidates during a design competition the following year. His proposal was largely oriented toward the public, with much of the site allocated to open gardens. Several years into the project, a combination of political and managerial impediments threatened its realization. It was shut down in 1994, but revived by a press and fund-raising campaign two years later.
The concert hall was designed as a single volume, with orchestra and audience occupying the same space. Seats are located on each side of the stage, providing some audience members with distant views of the performers’ sheet music. The former director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic felt boxes and balconies implied social hierarchies within the audience, and spatial segregation was minimized in the design. Curvilinear planes of Douglas fir provide the only partitions, delineating portions of the 2,265 member audience without creating visual obstructions. The steel roof structure spans the entire space, eliminating the need for interior columns. The organ stands at the front of the hall, a bouquet of 6,134 curved pipes extending nearly to the ceiling. It is the unique result of a collaboration between Gehry and Manuel J. Rosales, a Los Angeles-based organ designer.
Gehry worked with Yasuhisa Toyota, the acoustical consultant, to hone the hall’s sound through spatial and material means. To test the acoustics, they used a 1:10 scale model of the auditorium, complete with a model occupant in each seat. This required all elements to be scaled accordingly, including increasing the frequency of sound in the space to reduce the wavelength by a factor of ten. The concert hall's partitions and curved, billowing ceiling act as part of the acoustical system while subtly referencing the sculptural language of the exterior.
The exterior is a composition of undulating and angled forms, symbolizing musical movement and the motion of Los Angles. The design developed through paper models and sketches, characteristic of Gehry's process. The custom curvature demanded a highly specific steel structure, including box columns tilted forward at 17º on the building’s north side. Visitors can glimpse the steel frame through a skylight in the pre-concert room and view the supporting structure from a stairway leading to the garden.  
The reflective, stainless steel surface engages light as an architectural medium. The facade's individual panels and curves are articulated in daylight and colored by city lights after dark. The building was initially set to be clad in stone, but a more malleable material was chosen following the completion of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the concert hall's titanium-clad cousin. Thin metal panels allowed for more adventurous curvature and could be structurally disassociated from the ground. The metallic forms appear to hover above an asymmetrical band of glazing at the building’s base. Glass fissures in the facade bring light into the lobby and pre-concert room, reading as a grand entryway through the otherwise opaque facade.
The hall’s planning committee conceived of the project as a civic amenity, hoping it would serve as a catalyst in the activation of LA's downtown. Some critics debate the effectiveness of this siting strategy, acknowledging an increase in surrounding property values but little shift in the city's cultural epicenter. Perhaps that will change as development continues on the site. The Diller Scofidio + Renfro designed Broad Museum is under construction across the street, and Gehry himself recently announced he will rejoin the effort to develop the adjacent stretch of Grand Avenue. There may be a cost to creating a cultural center beside the concert hall, however. A new subway is scheduled to run 125 feet beneath the lowest level of the concert hall, and may disrupt the acoustics of the internationally recognized performance space.",2003,6100eb253a671e6970209ede

The cultural center in Paris, France turned our world inside out, literally. It all began with Georges Pompidou, President of France from 1969 to 1974, who wanted to construct a cultural center in Paris that would attract visitors and be a monumental aspect of the city.
In order to choose the architects for the project, the president held a competition and many entered, including some of the most famous architects in France at the time. People were astonished, however, when the design of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, both not famous at the time, won the competition. Their entry exemplified constructivism and was a high-tech modern cultural center structured with a system gerberettes and trusses unlike anything seen in the architectural world before.
Their concept, depicted in one of their competition drawings as a collage, was portraying the museum itself as movement. The other concept in their design, and perhaps the most obvious, was exposing all of the infrastructure of the building. The skeleton itself engulfs the building from its exterior, showing all of the different mechanical and structure systems not only so that they could be understood but also to maximize the interior space without interruptions.
The different systems on the exterior of the building are painted different colors to distinguish their different roles. The structure and largest ventilation components were painted white, stairs and elevator structures were painted a silver gray, ventilation was painted blue, plumbing and fire control piping painted green, the electrical elements are yellow and orange, and the elevator motor rooms and shafts, or the elements that allow for movement throughout the building, are painted red. One of the ""movement"" elements that the center is most known for is the escalator (painted red on the bottom) on the west facade, a tube that zigzags up to the top of the building providing visitors with an astonishing view of the city of Paris.",1977,6100eb253a671e6970209ed1

Amid a new sense of optimism, the year-long festival, which became known as the Millennium Experience, would take the form of an exhibition celebrating “who we are, what we do, and where we live.” Under the project direction of Mike Davies, a partner of Richard Rogers’ practice (known today as RSHP) designed the Millennium Dome to house this exhibition.
In an extraordinary feat of architecture and engineering, the vast dome, whose canopy encompasses a volume of 2.2million cubic meters, sped from initial concept design to topping out in only two years. Although the Millennium Experience closed its doors as the year 2000, the building which housed it has since been put to a variety of uses, its durability largely due to Richard Rogers’ characteristically flexible design.
The Millennium Dome was the focal point of a larger masterplan by Richard Rogers for a peninsula in Greenwich, London, on the south bank of the River Thames. From the outset this 300-acre site presented a multitude of difficulties. Before being purchased by the government for redevelopment, the site had been owned by British Gas who had used it for the disposal of toxic waste meaning that the land had to be decontaminated at great expense before construction work could commence. A ventilation shaft from the Blackwall Tunnel, which carries road traffic beneath the Thames, stood on the proposed site of the dome and needed to be accommodated into the design. The area was also poorly connected by public transport, and the road infrastructure was unable to accommodate the anticipated numbers of visitors. Fortunately, plans were already underway for an extension to the Jubilee Line on the London Underground network, and North Greenwich station opened on the peninsula in 1999.
A dome structure was chosen as the most appropriate design solution to the brief, largely due to the strict time constraints imposed on the project. It was only in 1996—comparatively late for a project of this scale—that the Greenwich peninsula was chosen as the site for the festival, and it was essential that all construction work be completed in 1998 in order to allow sufficient time for the exhibitions to be installed by the turn of the millennium. Rather than creating separate pavilions for each of the exhibitions which would make up the Millennium Experience, it was more time-efficient and cost-effective to create a single enclosure to house them all. According to Davies, the shape of the peninsula also suggested a circular structure: “the site had an incredible 270-degree sweep of the river, so a circle made sense.”
The design of the dome features a circle of twelve steel masts, one hundred meters high, which support a network of high-tensile cables. The seventy kilometers of cabling is covered by a canopy of white PTFE fabric just one millimeter thin, with an interior lining to absorb both sound and condensation. The Dome’s specifications are astonishing: it has a circumference of one kilometer, a height of fifty meters at its peak, and covers an area of eighty thousand square meters. In keeping with the festive spirit of the exhibition it housed, the architecture of the Dome was intended to convey a sense of optimism about the new millennium.
While the Millennium Dome makes architectural references to the past, the pure-white Teflon-coated PTFE fabric gives the structure a highly futuristic appearance; just one of the building’s many apparent contradictions. As the author Elizabeth Wilhide observed, “it is soft and hard, rounded and spiky; it hugs the ground and reaches for the sky.”[3] Technically it is not even a dome, as its load does not rest on its circumference but on the steel masts; a more accurate (but less marketable) description for it would be a ‘spherical cap’.
The Greenwich Meridian Line passes just meters away from the dome, and the design of the building contains many allusions to the concept of time. Davies, who describes himself as a “keen astronomer,”[4] specified that there should be twelve masts, one for each month of the year, and twenty-four ‘scallops’ (the curved cutouts at the base of the canopy), one for each hour of the day. Furthermore, the dome has a diameter of 365 meters, representing each day of the year, and the panels of the canopy are based on the celestial lines of longitude and latitude. These time-based references are particularly appropriate given the project’s purpose of celebrating a significant calendar event.
Sustainability was a key consideration in the design of the dome, with great care taken to minimize the environmental impact of the building. Rainwater runoff from the roof is collected into pools, naturally filtered through reed beds, and recycled as grey water for the toilets. The translucent fabric of the canopy allows sunlight to enter the Dome, thereby reducing the need for interior lighting and lowering the energy demands of the building.[5] Any energy which is needed comes from renewable sources, namely household waste, sewage and wind.[6] The dome is also naturally ventilated, with openings at the center of the roof releasing the rising hot air and twelve fans drawing in cool air from outside.
By necessity, the design process of the dome was a collaborative one, as the complexity of its engineering required the architects to work closely with the project engineers Buro Happold. Glyn Trippick, Structural Engineering Partner of Buro Happold, labelled the Dome “a true collaboration between architect and engineer. It’s one of the few projects where you can’t say that either has led.”[7] The stylistic influence of both firms can indeed be seen in the final design of the dome. Richard Rogers applied his signature ‘inside-out’ treatment to the building, placing the service plants of the building in cylindrical towers around the Dome’s exterior for easy access. As at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, various components of the building are color-coded: yellow is used for structural elements such as the masts, while orange is used for pedestrian circulation and red for the interior lighting towers.[8] Buro Happold, meanwhile, had a history of engineering tensile cable structures. The firm’s founder, Ted Happold, had collaborated with Frei Otto on several similar projects, such as the aviary at Munich Zoo.
The decision to build a single expansive dome, rather than individual pavilions, disassociated the architecture from the exhibition and created a more flexible architectural space. Richard Rogers had explored the use of assisted span structures in many of his earlier works, including the Fleetguard Factory in Brittany and the unbuilt Massy Autosalon.[9] Like the dome, these buildings are largely free of internal supports, allowing the layout of the spaces to be easily modified. At the dome, this flexibility was taken a step further. The service cylinders around the perimeter of the dome feature what Davies described as a “flexible racking system”,[10] wherein the outer fins of the cylinders can be easily detached and service plants added or removed as required.
Thanks to the great degree of flexibility in its design, the dome has been successfully adapted for multiple uses since the closure of the Millennium Experience. In 2003 the Dome hosted a music festival organized by the Mayor of London as well as a Winter Wonderland festival. The following year, the charity Crisis made use of the dome as a shelter for the homeless over the Christmas period. In 2007, after a two-year period of development, the dome reopened as an entertainment center. Rebranded as The O2 (after a sponsorship deal with the telecommunication company of the same name), it has since been successfully used as a venue for concerts and sporting events, hosting gymnastics and basketball competitions during the London 2012 Olympics.
The greatest success of the Millennium Dome does not lie in its contents, but in its triumphantly exuberant and celebratory architecture. The dome’s architects and engineers created one of the iconic structures of the 20th Century, and its endurance is a testament to their foresight and prowess. In designing an adaptable building, they allowed the dome to respond to the demands of a new millennium. Tony Blair, who championed the construction of the Millennium Dome as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, summarized its legacy: “we will celebrate the millennium with a new dynamism in our country. The Millennium Dome symbolizes this dynamism.”",1999,6100eb253a671e6970209ed3

",Residential,Villa Shodhan,Modern,"Le Corbusier was commissioned by the president of the Mill Owners’ Association to design the organization’s headquarters in Ahmedabad, a city historically active in India’s textile trade. The building is a physical manifesto representing Le Corbusier’s proposal for a modern Indian architecture. Constructed in 1954, the Mill Owners’ Association Building is considered the first of four completed commissions in Ahmedabad.

As Le Corbusier began working predominately in warmer environments, he developed a set of architectural devices in response to climatic and cultural contexts. He took cues from India’s vernacular architecture, emulating the deep reveals, overhanging ledges, shade screens, and grand, pillared halls. He introduced brises-soleil, designed to prevent sun from penetrating the facade, and employed these in combination with thickened facades and unfinished concrete in many of his later projects. Surrounded by ample open space, the Mill Owners’ Association Building was not forced to contend with an existing urban fabric, allowing the architect to propose a distinctly modern aesthetic. 

The building sits between Ashram Road to the west and the Sabarmati River to the east. The side walls, to the north and south, are nearly blank and faced in rough stone with a brick exterior. The brises-soleil on the west facade are oriented diagonally to obstruct views from the street while permitting air and indirect sunlight to enter the space. Plants spill from the porous facade, activating the exposed concrete and supplementing the roof garden. At the rear of the building, the brises-soleil are perpendicular to the facade, allowing the breeze from the river to pass uninhibited through the shaded perimeter. Here, Le Corbusier designed the openings to frame views of the river below.

“The situation of the building in a garden dominating the river furnishes a picturesque spectacle of cloth dyers washing and drying their cotton materials on the sand bed in the company of herons, cows, buffalo, and donkeys half immersed in the water to keep cool. Such a panorama was an invitation...to frame views from each floor of the building.” - Le Corbusier

Completed just after Unité de Habitation, the Mill Owners’ Association Building signifies a shift in Le Corbusier’s architectural style, combining the repetitive rigidity of Villa Savoye with the curvilinear forms of Ronchamp. The facade stands free of the structural pilotis as described in Le Corbusier’s Five Points, but departs from his earlier work in that it extends fully to the ground, screening the cylindrical columns from view. The rectilinear plan and grid expressed on the building’s exterior stand in contrast to the interior spaces, which are characterized by convex and concave volumes. As one moves through the interstitial space, the intersection of curvilinear and orthogonal planes creates an experience of compression and release. A conference room enclosed by a curved, brick wall paneled in wood veneer extends from the second story to roof level. Its curved ceiling reflects light entering through the clerestory window and holds a reflecting pool above, which Le Corbusier had hoped to utilize as a roof reservoir.

The circulation is designed as a promenade, beginning with a ramp extending from the parking lot to a three-story void at the volumetric center of the building. As one ascends the ramp, the view penetrates the brises-soleil, visually opening the facade. The stair core projects beyond the central atrium and main facade, into the elements. 

Surottam Hutheesing, who commissioned Le Corbusier to build the headquarters, also asked him to design a private residence. It was eventually realized in the Villa Shodhan after Hutheesing's original commission fell through. The design is consistent with the architect’s proposed architectural grammar for the region, employing deep, perforated walls, brises-soleil, and exposed concrete. For his sole commission in the United States, Le Corbusier constructed an iteration of the Mill Owners’ Association Building in the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",1954,6100eb253a671e6970209eda

",Singapore,Glass,Interpenetration,religious,Chee Tong Temple,Vernacular,"Chee Tong Temple is designed by Tay Kheng Soon, a leading mind on the subject of tropical architecture. Tropicality was born out of the aspiration to diverge from the reckless culture of importing and applying western architectural solutions in Singapore, to devise a design language that truly addresses the climatic conditions unique to the tropics.
To Tay Kheng Soon, the greatest hallmarks of tropical architecture lies in the interpenetration of outside and inside spaces and the roof of a building being the defining architectural characteristic instead of walls.
Chee Tong Temple is a departure from the conventional architectural paradigm for its lack of walls. Walls are an insulation solution for the Mediterranean and Temperate climates where summers are extremely hot and winters freezingly cold. As Singapore’s temperature and humidity does not vary significantly, Tay Kheng Soon believes the walls to have less importance in local architecture. As a result, the temple retains the roof but removes the membrane (walls) to not only address the lack of need for walls but also to create an interpenetration of outer and inner spaces. This concept of interpenetration is vital as it has the potential to encourage discourse on what constitutes tropical design in the architecture community and also the direction for more contextualised architecture for different regions and climates.
The fluid interplay of spaces is evident when visiting the temple. Upon ascending the initial flight of stairs, one stands outside of the roof, unclosed and unshaded by the temple. As a person moves towards the centre, the person will enter a transitionary space, a mix between outer and inner spaces. At this point, the unshaded outer spaces takes a significant proportion of the person’s view compared to the temple’s interior. The shade on the ground is faint and direct sunlight is still able to hit the ground. This provides a subtle hint of enclosure and confinement. 
Moving further toward the centre, the percentage of outer space in view significantly decreases, and there is close to no trace of direct sunlight striking the ground in the immediate vicinity. The floor in the centre is also elevated to further delineate a boundary. At this point, the role of the roof now acts as a wall which divides outer and inner spaces, emboldening the concept of enclosure. 
A three tiered structure sits at the peak of the temple’s roof to filter indirect sunlight to illuminate the otherwise dark temple. The structure makes smart use of glass, openings and mirrors to achieve the desired effect. The mirrors are slanted at around 45 degrees and reflect sunlight into the interior of the temple through the glass, which is sheltered by the mirrors above it.",1987,6100eb253a671e6970209ea5

Wet summers, dry winters. Summer, circa 33˚C, hot north-west winds. Winter south-east winds, temperatures rarely below 25˚C with lows of 20˚C on winter nights. Sandy soil with good drainage.
Commissioned by the aboriginal leader Banduk Marika and her partner Mark Alderton this project is in Yirrkala on land associated with the Marika clan. The project presented a rare opportunity to design a house in Australia’s extreme north and to architecturally address the inherent climatic and cultural conditions. Facing the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria the site has a tropical climate with cyclonic conditions, high winds and very heavy rainfall. Surrounded by a beach, estuary creek and freshwater lagoon, the building is slightly removed from a generally suburban settlement.
It was conceived by Murcutt as a prototype and as a viable alternative to the house then occupied by the clients, a brick building with small windows typical of aboriginal public housing in this context. Prefabricated in Gosford, north of Sydney, all components were packed in two shipping containers and transported to site via semi-trailer and barge. The house was bolted and screwed together on site, the entire process taking four months.
The building is elemental. A pitched roof, dry timber platform and operable skin float in relation to each other. The structural system is comprised of a steel frame and Australian hardwoods. The fine sheet metal roof is dominant, deep eaves protecting the interior from summer sun. The exterior wall is treated as finely crafted infill panels with no glazed openings. These typically plywood and slatted timber screens slide or pivot open allowing prevailing breezes to naturally cool the house.
One of the most striking aspects of the architecture is the southern façade, where vertical plywood blades of varying depths project out from the steel column line. These register the dimensions of different built-in furniture elements; a kitchen bench, timber joinery or beds, framed as floating window bays. The fins provide both visual privacy and shade from the summer sun in early morning and late afternoon. Voids under the bay structures confirm the sense of suspension above a horizontal floor plane. In this house Murcutt creates a situation from which the inhabitants can observe the horizon, changes in the weather patterns, the movement of people and animals and the playing of children; a building which is experienced as an elevated shaded platform.",1994,6100eb253a671e6970209eb9

","After 14 months of restoration, the punta della dogana museum by japanese architect, tadao ando opened to the public on june 6th during the venice art biennale.
The punta della dogana building in venice has a simple and rational structure. the volume forms a triangle that directly corresponds to the shape of the tip of dorsoduro island, whereas its interior space is dividend into long rectangles by a series of parallel walls. with great respect for this emblematic building, all partitions that had been added during previous renovations were thoroughly removed in order to recover its original form, at the very beginning of its construction.
The difficulties the architect encountered were largely due to the nature of the terrain – for example, the foundation of the church required the sinking of some 1,200,000 oak piles. the basic approach to the exterior renovation of the building consisted in carefully restoring the original façades, except the openings which were entirely replaced through this renovation.
The project conceived by architect tadao ando included restoration work at several levels: 
1. protection against water the base of punta della dogana is placed at 1.5 m above sea level. this positioning is relatively high in venice and represents a natural protection against the tides (to draw a comparison st. mark’s square is only 90 cm above sea level). in order to improve the building’s overall waterproofing, a protective shell was installed – also called a water hold-up tank – whose area is 2,500 sq. m. the hold-up tank is equipped with watertight bulkheads along the entire perimeter and mobile protections for the doors, thus ensuring protection against high water up to 2.10 m. thorough archaeological excavations were carried out before building the protective shell, using the most innovative technologies available.
2. structural consolidation and restoration of the masonry the building’s structural consolidation required the installation of micro-piles where the original foundations were insufficient (especially at the end of punta della dogana), as well as the fastening of the brick corner walls. as far as the walls are concerned, the architectural choice was to leave the masonry visible. bricks were adequately restored by eliminating all decay factors and replacing the most seriously damaged elements by adopting the traditional scuci-cuci (unstitching-stitching) method. this entails damaged bricks being replaced one by one with intact bricks, and laid with mortar of the same type as the original. over 5,000 sq. m were restored using recycled bricks selected from among those that offered the best guarantee for conservation purposes, and that featured color and shape as similar as possible to the original.the stone facing outside the complex was restored using traditional methods. it was structurally reinforced, where necessary, by inserting stainless steel bars, new tie-beams and lime-mortar injections, in order to fasten the fractures and mend the damage suffered by architectural and structural elements, as well as to eliminate the empty spaces between the facing and support.the exterior coating at the register of the gates’ arches was entirely recovered and restored. the heavy existing damage due to biological agents was inactivated by means of reiterated biocidal treatments which effectively contributed to the recovery of the surface. the rusticated façade, made of bricks covered in plaster, was selectively restored by rebuilding The plaster where the bosses were intact; otherwise, bricks, adequately restored, were left in full view.
the building’s original roofing was entirely restored. the 130 trusses constituting the structure’s original skeleton were almost entirely recovered. the recovery and consolidation treatment of the wooden surface amounts to nearly 9,000 sq. m of wood (including the floor framework). skylights permit the use of natural light in the museum’s halls. 90,000 tiles were laid on the roof, around 50% of which were original; it was also possible to recover about 50,000 out of 80,000 tavelle (thin quarries made of fired brick).
the work of restoration had to remove the unwanted accretions that had accumulated over time, with the new partition walls, stairs, walkways and service facilities all clearly identified as such. in effect, there is no attempt to disguise these new additions within the old body of the structure. instead, there is a continual play of juxtaposition – almost as if ando’s intention were to insert within the ancient building new volumes and levels that seem to mark out the stratifications
added over time, organizing them into a veritable spectacle of the structure’s own history. in the center of the building, a square space spans over two rows as a result of an earlier renovation. tadao ando inserted a ‘concrete box’ that dramatically transformed the space.
in order to create a rich materic effect with the elements in architectural concrete, and offer a token of the past, tadao ando selected the traditional venetian floor (the so-called masegni) for the centre of the cube. elsewhere, the floors were made of cement (ground floor) and linoleum (first floor). the floor heating system includes over 28 km of coils circulating hot water.",2009,6100eb253a671e6970209ec5

The design objective for T3 was to build on the character of the past with a modern perspective. As businesses look to new competitive models for attracting staff, the goal for T3 was to provide a warm and inviting environment that would attract and retain employers and employees.
T3, which stands for ‘Timber, Technology, Transit’, offers 224,000 square feet of office and retail space. Over 3,600 cubic meters of exposed mass timber columns, beams, and floor slabs recall the heavy timber construction of the building’s predecessors. T3’s modern technological approach uses engineered wood components (chiefly glulam and nail laminated timber) for the roof, floors, columns and beams, and furniture. A significant amount of the lumber used to fabricate the NLT comes from trees killed by the mountain pine beetle. These modern materials bring the warmth and beauty of wood to the interior, and promote a healthy indoor environment for occupants.
As a result of its wood structure, T3 was erected at a speed exceeding conventional steel-framed or concrete buildings. In less than 10 weeks, 180,000 square feet of timber framing went up, averaging 30,000 square feet of floor area installed per week. It is also lighter than comparable steel or concrete structures, reducing the depth and extent of excavation and foundations. Additionally, the embodied carbon in the building’s wood structural system is lower than that found in conventional buildings found throughout most of downtown Minneapolis and the North Loop.
The building’s aesthetic success can also be attributed to the mass timber construction. Candice Nichol, MGA Associate and T3 Project Lead, says “the texture of the exposed NLT is quite beautiful. The small imperfections in the lumber and slight variation in color of the mountain pine beetle wood only add to the warmth and character of the new space.”  Extensive exterior glazing at every level as well as views into the ground level social workspace with wood furniture, booths, and a feature stair, allow the public to experience the building.
The use of wood is celebrated throughout the building. “The entire timber structure of T3 was intentionally left exposed and illuminated with interior lighting directed up to the ceiling,” Nichol says. At night, “the illuminated wood will glow through the exterior openings.”
T3 is currently the largest completed mass timber building in the U.S. With changing building codes throughout North America, tall wood buildings will become more common. A pioneer in this building type, T3 has broken new ground and is perhaps a prototype for future commercial mass timber buildings.",2016,6100eb253a671e6970209ecf

The future brings decreasing resources, increasing population, and climate change, reasons MVRDV, and with these limitations in mind, they believe futuristic architecture needs one important quality: flexibility.
Dutch Design Week challenged designers to shift their mindset to create futuristic hypotheses where architecture and science intersect. Designers were asked, how can architecture facilitate a quickly changing, and at times deteriorating, world?
“Through gaming and other tools, (W)ego explores participatory design processes to model the competing desires and egos of each resident in the fairest possible way,” said co-founder of MVRDV and Dutch Design Week ambassador Winy Maas.
The physical manifestation of (W)ego at Dutch Design Week shows nine urban dwellings in one possible configuration. Each unit has its own personality for the user that occupies it: an orange door to ascension, a lime green space with hammock and ladders, tropical pink that extends up a few floors, a lemon yellow privatized penthouse, and a blue cave—but the possibilities posed by the concept are endless. During its time on display, (W)ego plays a film in one of its nine rooms which details the extent of its potential configurations.
As one enters (W)ego they have to come to terms with others' spatial needs while deciding their own spatial desires. Ultimately, (W)ego begs the question: what is going on next door?",2017,6100eb253a671e6970209ed0

The Cinema Block opens up towards the street and is permeable for pedestrian traffic. It is differentiated by the circulation system of the cinemas and by views through to the street. The Crystal is no longer merely a functional entry hall to the cinemas, but an urban passageway. The urban quality of the space is reinforced by circulation systems of stairs and bridges which allow views of people through layers of light and color.


The eight cinemas extend over four floors including the basement and offer seating for 2,600 people. The different levels are connected by free floating stairs and an elevator. The bridges, ramps and stairs to the cinemas are themselves urban expressions. They allow views of the movement of people on a multitude of levels, unfolding the urban place into three dimensions. The lively quality of this space can be described in relation to the dynamic structure of film. The Skybar, the ""floating"" double-cone inside the foyer, is accessible and will host different functions (café, bar etc.).

Resisting recent trends of incorporating public libraries and much-needed social space within high- end residential towers, the Hunters Point Library stands independently, rising with a minimal footprint on its 32,000 square foot site to offer maximum surrounding green space to the local community and becoming an integrated part of the vibrant public park that lines the river’s edge.
The vertical structure reimagines the traditional library model, providing a diversity of spaces from intimate reading areas to active gathering spaces. The building’s aluminum-painted concrete shell is not just a facade but a load-bearing structure, which omits curtain walls and columns. Sculpted cuts are carved out of the facade, showing the movement of people within and framing expansive views of the Manhattan skyline. 
The program's separation into children's area, teen area, and adult area can be read in the sculpted cuts of the east face of the building, one facade opening for each area; yet the programmatic divisions are fluid. Inside, warm bamboo creates an inviting social space, open to the community and offering engaging spaces for all ages. Natural light enters through the large windows from all sides, animating the space.
The digital and the book are merged through the bookshelves and adjacent digital workstations that flow upward along with a series of open stairs. A ground-level auditorium under the main section provides public meeting and events space. The stairs switch back from the mezzanine to the mezzanine, connecting reading areas and concluding in a rooftop reading terrace with views of the city and the river.
While the plan is compact, the building section of the new library is open and flowing to allow for the most energy-efficient design and the greatest amount of public green space on the site. On the east entrance side, the library faces a reading garden bordered by a low park office pavilion with a bosque of ginkgo trees.  At night the glowing presence of the Hunters Point Library along the waterfront joins the Pepsi sign and the ""Long Island"" sign at the old Gantry to become a beacon for this new community place.",2019,6100eb253a671e6970209eae

Located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, in the Piedmont region, the plantation was originally 5,000 acres (20 km2). Due to its architectural and historic significance, the property has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1987, Monticello and the nearby University of Virginia, also designed by Jefferson, were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
Jefferson designed the main house using neoclassical design principles described by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and reworking the design through much of his presidency to include design elements popular in late 18th-century Europe and integrating numerous ideas of his own. Situated on the summit of an 850-foot (260 m)-high peak in the Southwest Mountains south of the Rivanna Gap, the name Monticello derives from Italian meaning ""little mountain"". 
In this later construction period, Jefferson fundamentally changed the proportions of Monticello. If the early construction gave the impression of a Palladian two-story pavilion, Jefferson’s later remodeling, based in part on the Hôtel de Salm (1782-87) in Paris, gives the impression of a symmetrical single-story brick home under an austere Doric entablature. The west garden façade—the view that is once again featured on the American nickel—shows Monticello’s most recognized architectural features. The two-column deep extended portico contains Doric columns that support a triangular pediment that is decorated by a semicircular window. Although the short octagonal drum and shallow dome provide Monticello a sense of verticality, the wooden balustrade that circles the roofline provides a powerful sense of horizontality. From the bottom of the building to its top, Monticello is a striking example of French Neoclassical architecture in the United States.
By helping to introduce classical architecture to the United States, Jefferson intended to reinforce the ideals behind the classical past: democracy, education, rationality, civic responsibility. Because he detested the English, Jefferson continually rejected British architectural precedents for those from France. In doing so, Jefferson reinforced the symbolic nature of architecture. Jefferson did not just design a building; he designed a building that eloquently spoke to the democratic ideals of the United States. This is clearly seen in the Virginia State Capitol, in the Rotunda at the University of Virginia, and especially in his own home, Monticello.",1772,6100eb253a671e6970209ebb

However, the clarity of this form is obfuscated by the fragmentation of its faces, which are subdivided into a series of equilateral triangles with minor distortions that bow the individual planar sections into shells. As a result, the aggregate composition of the dome is substantially more spherical than simple icosahedra, while the smaller units create dazzling visual complexity through sheer repetitiousness. This lattice-type structure is created entirely of three-inch steel tubes, welded at the joints and thinning gently toward the top of the structure so as to optimally distribute forces throughout the system.

Originally sheathed in a thin acrylic membrane that was destroyed by fire in 1976, the dome as originally built was more opaque and visually solid than the version experienced today. However, its present structural nakedness, though unintended by the architect, creates a beautifully legible transparency that fully reveals the ingenuity of Fuller’s design.",1967,6100eb253a671e6970209ebc

The ETFE cladding, supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec, allows more light and heat penetration than traditional glass, resulting in a 30% decrease in energy costs. This choice was made in view of Beijing's goal of presenting a fully ""green"" Olympic Games, with zero net growth in total carbon emissions. Likewise, the venue was also designed to ""capture and recycle 80% of the water falling on the roof or lost from the pools.""

The outer wall is based on the Weaire–Phelan structure, a structure devised from the natural pattern of bubbles in soap lather. In the true Weaire–Phelan structure the edge of each cell is curved in order to maintain 109.5 degree angles at each vertex (satisfying Plateau's rules), but of course as a structural support system each beam was required to be straight so as to better resist axial compression. The complex Weaire–Phelan pattern was developed by slicing through bubbles in soap foam, resulting in more irregular, organic patterns than foam bubble structures proposed earlier by the scientist Kelvin. Using the Weaire–Phelan geometry, the Water Cube's exterior cladding is made of 4,000 ETFE bubbles, some as large as 9.14 meters (30 ft) across, with seven different sizes for the roof and 15 for the walls.",2007,6100eb253a671e6970209ebf

The museum is surrounded by a landscaped park that reinterprets Qatari landscapes, with alternating low dunes, flooded crops, and gardens inspired by sabkhas and oases. Containing only local plants and trees, the park tells the story of Qatar and how its people lived in and cultivated the harsh environment. It includes a heritage garden of traditional plants and large grassy areas perfect for stretching out on in the evening. A 430-car parking area is seamlessly integrated into the park.
The building is composed of large interlocking disks, spherical in section, and of different diameters and varying curvatures. Some disks are ‘horizontal’ and rest on other disks. The ‘vertical’ disks constitute the building’s support and transfer the loads of the horizontal planes to the base.  Like the exterior, the interior is a landscape of interlocking disks. The finishes are neutral and monochromatic. The floors are sand-colored polished concrete with tiny mineral aggregates.

The 500-seat performance venue is designed to stage performances ranging from orchestras and chamber music to jazz, theatre, dance and art, and it will host the Lucerne Festival of music this autumn in Matsushima.
""We named the Project Ark Nova, or 'new ark', with the hope that it will become a symbol of recovery immediately after the great earthquake disaster,"" said the designers.
""Ark Nova obviously can't carry people and animals to escape from disaster, but we conceived the ark to travel packed with music and various arts, from the perspective of long-term rebuilding of culture and spirit,"" they added.
The walls of the structure are made from a stretchy plastic membrane, designed to enable quick erection and dismantling. To transport it to a new venue, the orb is completely deflated and loaded onto the back of a lorry alongside the disassembled equipment.
The designers first revealed their concept for Ark Nova back in September 2011.

The centre has been housed at 68 Woodstock Road (the former rectory of the Church of St Philip and St James, built in 1887) since 1978.
The Middle East Centre holds Oxford University’s primary collection on the modern Middle East, a world-class archive of private papers and historic photographs used by scholars and researchers with an interest in the region. The centre’s research core is the specialised library, document and photographic archive covering material from the 1800’s onwards. The archive was set up in 1961 and has grown to over 400 collections of private papers and holds more than 100,000 historic photographs.
The new Investcorp Building for the Middle East Centre provides 1,127 square metres of additional floor space and a new 117-seat lecture theatre; doubling the space available for the Middle East Centre’s expanding library & archive, and providing optimum conditions to conserve and manage the centre’s collections that were previously stored in the basement of 66 Woodstock Road.
As an integral part of the college’s on-going expansion plans, the Investcorp Building incorporates essential new facilities to meet the Middle East Centre’s increasing demand for research and academic activities. The need to expand the teaching space at the centre has become increasingly acute with student numbers growing dramatically in recent years, including many additional masters’ students and doctoral candidates.
The Invescorp Building complements the college’s ongoing development. Its design weaves through the restricted site at St Antony’s College to connect and incorporate the existing protected buildings and trees; while its stainless steel façade softly reflects natural light to echo the building’s context.

Postmodernism
Critical Regionalism","Louis Kahn’s Capitol Complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is an epic work in the annals of modern architecture that is still shrouded in mystery. Dhaka was a critical site of Kahn’s new overtures in the Modernist cosmos. Located at the geographical and ideological edge of that cosmos, the project literally expanded the horizon of modern architecture, which was stagnating in its own ideological doldrums. In amalgamating a primordial intensity with a modern programme, and resuscitating the eroded civic purpose of architecture, Kahn was able to articulate in Dhaka a kind of mystical Modernism (which some would describe as a precursor to Postmodernism).
What made Kahn’s ideas in Dhaka compelling was his near-mystical optimism for the virtues of architecture at a time when modern architecture was subject to an understandable assault. Through his family of forms and poetic thoughts, Kahn resorted to a re-appreciation of history and human institutions. He heralded a breach in what the Italian critic Maria Bottero saw as the closed circuits of Wright’s organicism and European rationalism, the major strands of modern architecture culture at that time. By the time Kahn arrived in Dhaka, he had internalised history and the 20th century almost seamlessly: one could say that if he was Roman in his architectural orientation, he was Mughal too. If he was modern, he was also primordial, and if he was a 20th-century architect, he was also an ancient alchemist. Dhaka was the critical venue of that transformative moment in modern architecture.
Composed as a miniature city, Sher-e-Bangla Nagar is characterised by two aggregations set on a north-south axis separated by gardens and lakes, and ordered by a network of rectilinear and diagonal elements (of buildings, landscape components and pathways). Design for the National Assembly Building’s centralised plan started predictably: within a taut orthogonal geometry, the main assembly chamber occupied the centre ringed by subservient spaces (of offices, meeting rooms, cafeterias, etc). In a progressive development of the design, elements of the outer ring gradually became detached from the main volume and increasingly gained fi gural autonomy providing light and view for the interior. In this process the taut geometry was transformed into a Baroque dynamic of concavity and convexity, with the exterior ‘facade’ undulating back and forth. The central chamber was articulated within the stunning street-like ambulatory space and an encirclement of light and air wells; light-hoods irrupted into the skyline as gigantic perforations positioned towards the city. The physiognomy of the National Assembly Building is characterised by a simultaneous autonomy and integration between the centre and the periphery.
In addition to local innovations in concrete construction for the National Assembly Building, Kahn reinvigorated the poetry of brick architecture with its powerful resonance in the region. In Kahn’s new order of a brick architecture, with its geometry of form, deep shadows, earth-hugging physiognomy, and articulation of the arch with the concrete tie, he introduced a new vocabulary in the repertoire of regional modern architecture, and perhaps inaugurated what would be later described as ‘critical regionalism’.
With the gigantic perforations in the envelope of the National Assembly Building and the brick buildings, Kahn not only created cavernous spaces of shadows in response to the tropical climate, he surreptitiously ‘landscaped’ the buildings. In allowing nature – the sun, wind and rain of the delta – to ‘invade’ an artefact, erode its envelope, make it porous, and finally repossess it, Kahn made the dynamics of weathering and landscaping visible in the building.",1963,6100eb253a671e6970209eca

His belief that architecture should be as efficient as machinery resulted in such proposals such as the Plan Voisin, a proposal to transform the Second Empire boulevards of Paris into a series of cruciform skyscrapers rising from a grid of freeways and open parks.[1] Not all of Le Corbusier’s concepts, however, were geared toward such radical urban transformation. His 1965 proposal for a hospital in Venice, Italy, was notable in its attempt at seeking aesthetic harmony with its unique surroundings: an attempt not to eradicate history, but to translate it.

There was no shortage of demand for Le Corbusier’s work in Italy after the end of the Second World War. The country experienced incredible economic growth in the decades following the war; what had previously been primarily an agricultural economy rapidly transformed into a major industrial nation. The architect had already been commissioned to design a new headquarters for the Olivetti Company outside of Milan when the city of Venice approached him with their own commission for a new hospital. The new building, which would stand in the neighborhood of San Giobbe, was to serve as a facility for care of the seriously and terminally ill.

Le Corbusier’s proposal did not stand out from the rest of the city as a brazen Modernist landmark. Rather, it utilized the existing urban vocabulary to appear as a seamless continuation of the old city. The hospital was conceived as a network of interconnected modules clustered around a number of square courtyards, a clear analogue for Venice’s traditional urban fabric. As with the rest of the city’s buildings, the new hospital was supported by a number of piles driven into the Venetian silt. However, these were not typical wooden piles; in reference to his own design canon, Le Corbusier chose instead to perch the hospital atop a grid of his trademark concrete pillars, or pilotis. The overall intent was that the new hospital would extend the urban fabric rather than interrupt it.

While Le Corbusier chose to emulate the typical Venetian structural typology, he did not sacrifice functionalism to do so. The modules that comprised the hospital were to be almost identical, featuring 28 patient rooms facing onto three corridors; four of these squares, dubbed ""care units,"" were arranged around a small central square, the corners of which branched off into corridors connecting to other squares. The system was designed to allow the hospital to expand as needed in the future, ensuring it would have space both for added patient load and newly-invented medical equipment. The hospital was also vertically stratified programmatically: administrative and entry services were located at the ground level, patient bedrooms were on the top floor, and all other hospital program needs on the level between the two.

One curious aspect of the design was the lack of conventional windows in the care units. The only daylight to enter the space did so through clerestory windows along the inner corridor walls of each hospital room; an American journal considered this an “unkindness,” as it denied patients the opportunity to gaze out at the Venetian lagoon during their stay.

Another design move which elicited concern was the automobile gangway leading from the Santa Lucia Railway Station directly to the hospital’s ground level entry. Though an automobile causeway had already been built alongside the rail bridge leading from the mainland to the station, Le Corbusier’s proposal would have brought cars even further into a city that remained largely devoid of their presence – firmly out of choice. The same journal which questioned the lack of conventional windows considered the provision for automobiles “inexcusable,” even declaring that it was the one feature that would prevent the hospital from achieving the same architectural vitality as the surrounding historical structures.

Given Le Corbusier’s typical contempt for pre-existing urban fabrics, his deference to the traditional Venetian aesthetic seems anomalous. In the brief of his Plan Voisin, he decried the Haussmann-era buildings and boulevards of Paris as a grotesque mix of mismatched buildings and narrow trenches – a relic which, he insisted, was nothing short of disgusting. While he reviled Paris, however, he developed a peculiar fondness for Venice. As early as the 1930’s, he referenced the Italian city as an ideal urban model, lauding its canal network and the acceptance of multiple architectural forms and styles without the need for false, superficial continuity. While Paris would represent his Modernist desire to wipe the slate clean and build anew, it was in Venice that he would contradictorily espouse the benefits of historic preservation.

The Venice Hospital project came very late in Le Corbusier’s life; he proposed the final design only a few months before his passing in 1965. Debates over the value of the hospital as a form of urban renewal ultimately became moot as, due to a lack of funding, the city ultimately chose a different design for a site on the mainland. Nonetheless, Le Corbusier’s proposal represents the synthesis of his seemingly contradictory viewpoints – a sort of functional, Modernist historicism. It was fitting, perhaps, that Le Corbusier’s final design project was for a city that he came to admire so deeply.",1965,6100eb253a671e6970209ed8

The dormitory is a curving snake slithering on its site and reflects many of Aalto's ideas of formal strategy, making it a dormitory that is both inhabited and studied by students from all over the world.  
""The site runs along the north side of the Charles River and from the very start Aalto's plans seek to find ways of maximizing the view of the river for every student. 
Early sketches show clusters of rooms facing south and, because a simple single-sided slab would not contain sufficient rooms, several ways of increasing the density: by parallel blocks in echelon, by fan-shaped ends, and by the ""giant gentle polygon"" resolving itself into a sinuous curve, that was finally adopted.""  
The building's undulating form also does not subject the views of the rooms to be oriented at right angles towards the busy street. The form established a wide variety of room shapes, creating 43 rooms and 22 different room shapes per floor that although similar, still required distinct designs for the placement of built-in furniture.  
The plan is composed around a single-loaded corridor. Aalto refused to design north-facing rooms since he wanted most rooms to have a view of the river from the east or west, and thus proposed enlarging the rooms on the western end into large double and triple rooms that receive both northern and western light.
Built with dark red rustic bricks, the modular pieces come together to create sweeping curves that juxtapose the solid limestone of the attached rectilinear common room. The common room is a calm static space in comparison to the movement of the dormitories. ",1948,6100eb253a671e6970209e9f

The design includes gallery spaces for a museum, work spaces and a guest house. Conceived as a spiralling glass pavilion embedded in the landscape, BIG's design - entilted Maison des Fondateurs - will take visitors on a narrative journey through the company's 139-year history.
The spiralling form was conceived as a response to a programmatic requirement, which called for a succession of galleries and workshops, however the logistics of the workshops required them to be connected. The spiral shape allows the workshops to be spread along the narrative path through the building, while being physically adjacent.

The roof of the structure is a continuous sheet of steel clad in brass. Its undulating form allows breaks in the roofline, giving an opportunity for light to enter and for views out. This lightweight roof is supported by structural glass walls which simultaneously control the route through the building while allowing the visitor views of the whole gallery.

In addition to the pavilion-like museum structure, the building includes a subterranean guest house, with views over the Vallée de Joux.
Commenting on the design, Bjarke Ingels said: ""Watchmaking like architecture is the art and science of invigorating inanimate matter with intelligence and performance. It is the art of imbuing metals and minerals with energy, movement, intelligence and measure – to bring it to life in the form of telling time. Unlike most machines and most buildings today that have a disconnect between the body and the mind, the hardware and the software, for the Maison des Fondateurs we have attempted to completely integrate the geometry and the performance, the form and the function, the space and the structure, the interior and the exterior in a symbiotic whole.

By small but significant shifting of the cubes, the building gets dynamicity and an attracting shape, being different but similar to the near constructions.
The program of the Museum consists of four public galleries at the first four floors, which have free and flexible spaces for exhibitions; a “white box” auditorium in the basement, Education Center at the 5th floor, offices at 6th, a multi-purpose room at the 7th. By shifting the boxes, all galleries get natural illumination, combined with artificial, and the offices and the private locals on the top floors get terraces and opening views to the cityscape.
It is in that way that the project shows its concept: by simple repeated shifting, the intention of the building is clearly readable from outside, and combines a convincing language with the need of natural light from top: all at once, with one operation, the project shows its force.
Wanting to be a light and clean object in the massive Manhattan cityscape, the materials and the façade appearance play a relevant role. The choice of a layer of anodized aluminium mesh on top of the white walls is not new and unknown to most of architects. But in the Museum it is used as a wrapped skin on all vertical surfaces, as a continuous blurring layer, that gives different light reflections and hides the offices windows, doors and balustrades of the terraces. The result is an elegant, light and white succession of surfaces, without any interruption or contamination by other elements: a semi-transparent dress for the shifting body of the building.",1977,6100eb253a671e6970209ec2

True to Ando's minimal style – demonstrated by projects like Church of the Light and the Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum – the theatre features a concrete structure, but here it is encased behind a glass and aluminium curtain wall.

The flexibility of the interior spaces and the obviously planar quality of the house both give it an edge that makes it distinguishable and unique on every level.
The Schroder House is the only building that was designed in complete accordance with the De Stijl style,  which was marked by primary colors and pure ideas. 
Founded in 1917, the movement was named after a periodical that became the most influential voice for the ideals of modern art and architecture in the Netherlands; other famous people of the movement include Piet Mondrian and J.J.P. Oud. The group of artists and architects “sought for the universal, as the individual was losing its significance... abstraction, precision, geometry, striving towards artistic purity and austerity.”
Upon the death of Mr. Schroder Schrader, his wife felt the need to move into a smaller house with their three kids, where she would live until her death in 1985. The two-story house contains a transformable kitchen/dining/living area, studio space and reading room on the bottom, and the second floor contained bedrooms and storage space, only separated by portable partitions.
The flexibility of space meant that there was no hierarchical arrangement of rooms in the floor plan. The collapsable walls upstairs positioned around a central staircase were designed to provide the children with an option of pushing the partitions in during the day for an open play space and closing them at night for private bedrooms. 
The three criteria given by Mrs. Schroder about the rooms for her kids stated that a bed should be able to fit in two different positions, each room should have access to the water supply and drainage, and all should have a door to access the outdoors directly.
This kind of detail was well planned by Rietveld and was prominent in other areas of the design, like specific paint colors to distinguish different spaces or functions. An interesting example of this is the front door, where black paint is used because Rietveld anticipated it would be accessed the most and would therefore be easily soiled.
What makes the Schroder House an icon of the Modern Movement is its radical approach to design, the use of space, and the purity of its concepts and ideas as represented in the De Stijl movement. Its transformational quality of evenly matched spaces composed of independent planes perfectly met the goals of the De Stijl movement. 
The main structure of the house is of reinforced concrete slabs and steel profiles. Walls are made of brick and plaster; window frames, doors, and floors were made from wood. To preserve the strict design standards about intersecting planes, the windows are hinged so that they are only able to open 90 degrees to the wall.",1925,6100eb253a671e6970209ec6
Gunnar Asplund,"With its simple geometry and classical arrangement, Stockholm’s Public Library is a difficult building to characterize. Designed by noted Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund during the 1920s, the library is the physical manifestation of a transitionary period in both the rationale of its designer and the shifting values of European architecture. The ultimate result is a deceptively complex synthesis of styles presented in a visually straightforward package: the fading influence of Neoclassicism juxtaposed against the emergence of Rationalism.
Swedish architects of the late 19th Century were faced by a difficult decision. Much like the rest of the world, they had started to reject the Classicism that had characterized European design for centuries. But, at the same time, there was no clear “replacement” available. Increasing cultural divergence with Norway and Finland and mass emigration from Sweden to the United States in the closing years of the century had created a strong push for national identity, making the use of Art Nouveau—a foreign, ‘international’ aesthetic—unattractive to the new generation of architects. Instead, they sought to blend aspects of the country’s traditional architecture with Modernist rationale, resulting in the uniquely Swedish “National Romanticism.”
It was in this atmosphere of nationalism versus Modernity that Erik Gunnar Asplund began his architectural career.
The central goal of the library, he posited, was to provide knowledge, in the form of books, to the public as easily as possible. The library, therefore, was to be organized in such a way that finding the particular book one needed should be as efficient and straightforward as possible. Although the underlying premise of the new institution was a classless one, Asplund also realized that establishing its legitimacy in the community required a degree of monumentalism, a decision which critics later derided as being antithetical to the humble nature of a public library.
Asplund’s design for the Stockholm Public Library was, at first, purely traditional, with a coffered dome, porticoed entry, and lavish exterior wall treatments more suited to a palazzo than a 20th Century library in Scandinavia. The layout of this scheme was essentially retained but, in Modernist fashion, was distilled down to its most primitive geometric elements: a cylinder emerging from a rectilinear box. Sitting at a slight angle from the street and the surrounding landscaping, the austere bulk of the library is seemingly magnified. The walls are finished in stucco, allowing the formal purity of the structure to maintain its full visual impact on visitors and passers-by.
Visitors to the library ascend (process up) a staircase and through an Egyptian-style doorway into the library’s main space: the reading room. Occupying the central cylinder, the reading room is a cavernous space ringed with three terraced levels of open shelving. Above the book stacks, the roughly stuccoed walls rise the full height of the cylinder, with light streaming in from a ring of windows near the flat ceiling. In keeping with the library committee’s original findings, the space is highly reminiscent of the work of Etienne Louis-Boullée, a French Revolutionary architect with a similar flair for the monumental. The space was also intended as a reference to the Roman Pantheon, in which the coffers would have been replaced with recessed skylights. The decision to replace the dome with a flat roof meant that the reference was ultimately a more abstract one, although the library’s paving is still similar to the Pantheon’s marble floor.

Designed by noted Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund during the 1920s, the library is the physical manifestation of a transitionary period in both the rationale of its designer and the shifting values of European architecture. The ultimate result is a deceptively complex synthesis of styles presented in a visually straightforward package: the fading influence of Neoclassicism juxtaposed against the emergence of Rationalism.
Swedish architects of the late 19th Century were faced by a difficult decision. Much like the rest of the world, they had started to reject the Classicism that had characterized European design for centuries. But, at the same time, there was no clear “replacement” available. Increasing cultural divergence with Norway and Finland and mass emigration from Sweden to the United States in the closing years of the century had created a strong push for national identity, making the use of Art Nouveau—a foreign, ‘international’ aesthetic—unattractive to the new generation of architects. Instead, they sought to blend aspects of the country’s traditional architecture with Modernist rationale, resulting in the uniquely Swedish “National Romanticism.”
It was in this atmosphere of nationalism versus Modernity that Erik Gunnar Asplund began his architectural career.
The central goal of the library, he posited, was to provide knowledge, in the form of books, to the public as easily as possible. The library, therefore, was to be organized in such a way that finding the particular book one needed should be as efficient and straightforward as possible. Although the underlying premise of the new institution was a classless one, Asplund also realized that establishing its legitimacy in the community required a degree of monumentalism, a decision which critics later derided as being antithetical to the humble nature of a public library.
Asplund’s design for the Stockholm Public Library was, at first, purely traditional, with a coffered dome, porticoed entry, and lavish exterior wall treatments more suited to a palazzo than a 20th Century library in Scandinavia. The layout of this scheme was essentially retained but, in Modernist fashion, was distilled down to its most primitive geometric elements: a cylinder emerging from a rectilinear box. Sitting at a slight angle from the street and the surrounding landscaping, the austere bulk of the library is seemingly magnified. The walls are finished in stucco, allowing the formal purity of the structure to maintain its full visual impact on visitors and passers-by.
Visitors to the library ascend (process up) a staircase and through an Egyptian-style doorway into the library’s main space: the reading room. Occupying the central cylinder, the reading room is a cavernous space ringed with three terraced levels of open shelving. Above the book stacks, the roughly stuccoed walls rise the full height of the cylinder, with light streaming in from a ring of windows near the flat ceiling. In keeping with the library committee’s original findings, the space is highly reminiscent of the work of Etienne Louis-Boullée, a French Revolutionary architect with a similar flair for the monumental. The space was also intended as a reference to the Roman Pantheon, in which the coffers would have been replaced with recessed skylights. The decision to replace the dome with a flat roof meant that the reference was ultimately a more abstract one, although the library’s paving is still similar to the Pantheon’s marble floor.
Upon its completion in 1928, the Stockholm Public Library marked a turning point in not only Asplund’s work, but in the greater course of Swedish architecture. National Romanticism had vanished from Asplund’s vocabulary in the creation of the library, abandoned in favor of a more universal aesthetic based more on Enlightenment values.

Fire Station",Vitra Fire Station,Contemporary,"An initial study of the Vitra factory site informed our designs for the Vitra Fire Station – a building conceived as the key element within a linear landscaped zone, the artificial extension of linear patterns in adjacent fields and vineyards – designed as a connecting unit rather than an isolated object; defining rather than occupying space.
The new fire station – long, linear, narrow – emerges as a layered series of tilted and breaking walls, between which program elements are contained within spaces visible only from a perpendicular viewpoint. On passing, brilliant red fire vehicles are glimpsed, their lines of movement inscribed in surrounding asphalt – a visual grammar also used to inscribe the ritualized exercises completed by fire teams. This building is ‘movement frozen’ – a vivid, lucid expression of the tensions necessary to remain ‘alert’, to explode into action as required. Walls appear to slide one across the other, main sliding doors form a ‘moving’ wall.
The whole building is constructed from exposed, reinforced in-situ concrete, marked by the sharpness of all edges and the absence of all edgings and claddings to retain the clarity and simplicity of this prismatic volume.
This same absence of detail informed the frameless glazing, the sliding planes enclosing the garage, and the treatment of the interior spaces, in which lines of light are direct, logical and precise.
29-Jul-2010 We initiated our design with a study of the overall factory site. Our intention was to place the elements of our commission in such a way that they would not be lost between the enormous factory sheds. We also used these elements to structure the whole site, giving identity and rhythm to the main street running through the complex. This street - which stretches from the chair museum to the other end of the factory site, where the fire station is now located, was envisaged as a linear landscaped zone, almost as if it were the artificial extension of the linear patterns of the adjacent agricultural fields and vineyards. Thus, rather than designing the building as an isolated object, it was developed as the outer edge of the landscaped zone: defining space rather than occupying space. This was achieved by stretching the programme into a long, narrow building alongside the street which marks the edge of the factory site, and which also functions as a screening device against the bordering buildings.
The space-defining and screening functions of the building were the point of departure for the development of the architectural concept: a linear, layered series of walls. The programme of the firestation inhabits the spaces between these walls, which puncture, tilt and break according to functional requirements. The building is hermetic from a frontal reading, revealing the interiors only from a perpendicular viewpoint. As one passes across the spaces of the firestation, one catches glimpses of the large red fire engines. Their lines of movement are inscribed into the asphalt. Similarly, the ritualized exercises of the firemen will be inscribed into the ground; a series of choreographic notations. The whole building is movement, frozen. It expresses the tension of being on the alert; and the potential to explode into action at any moment. The walls appear to slide past each other, while the large sliding doors literally form a moving wall. The whole building is constructed of exposed, reinforced in-situ concrete. Special attention was given to the sharpness of all edges; any attachments like roof edgings or claddings were avoided as they distract from the simplicity of the prismatic form and the abstract quality of the architectural concept. This same absence of detail informed the frameless glazing, the large sliding planes enclosing the garage, and the treatment of the interior spaces including the lighting scheme. The lines of light direct the necessarily precise and fast movement through the building.",1993,6100eb253a671e6970209edb

Construction of the church was completed in 1958. Without any doubt Aalto’s most original church design, Vuoksenniska Church – in conformity with his fundamental approach to architecture as a synthesis of varied practical and aesthetic needs – fuses a broad range of motifs into a unique, coherent work of artistic perfection.
“The architect aimed at the full form of a church, while seeking to provide adequately for social activities without compromises. The basic design of the church consists of a series of three consecutive halls. We may call these halls A, B, and C; A being the sanctuary proper, while the other spaces can be added if necessary by means of moveable walls. On weekdays halls B and C can be used for parish activities. Each section has just under 300 seats, A and B together approximately 600, and all halls combined 800. — Divine service in a Lutheran church calls for three architectural focuses: the altar, the pulpit, and an organ loft for music and choir. All three are accommodated within a triangular form in the main church, A. As the most sacred section of the church, the altar is centrally placed, and the pulpit is generally relegated to one side. Considering that the audibility of the sermon is the most important and most difficult problem in a Lutheran church, this should logically result in an asymmetrical church interior.”
The division of the interior into three units gave Aalto the occasion to raise the number three into a more widely applicable, theologically justified motif: “The bell tower is dominated by the number three: its top section is tripartite, and widens upward. With this form the architect wished to create an architectural image that contrasts as strongly as possible with the factory chimneys which dominate the surroundings. The triad recurs inside in the vault which covers the three halls. The motif converges at the altar in three unpretentious crosses.”
The church has five entrances to ensure undisturbed separate use of the three sections, and hall A can also be used as a funeral chapel with a ceremonial exit straight to the graveyard in a beautiful pine forest setting. The church facade is of brick and concrete, rendered white; the roofing, which hangs down low on the east side, is copper sheet.",1958,6100eb253a671e6970209edc

Wright called the community Usonia, a descriptive term he used to embody the character of the American landscape that was free from previous architectural conventions. Wright created a plan for the community that followed the contours of the land and retained many of the original trees. He laid out circular lots and designated the areas between the lots as common green space. He plotted where each of 47 houses would be built and designed three of the homes himself, while approving plans for the other 44. Each house has an approximately 1.25-acre plot of land, with 47 homes arranged on 100 acres, with roads, pool areas and woodlands.

The first of the three Wright-designed houses to be built was constructed for Bertha and Sol Friedman in 1948. Friedman was a retailer of books, records and toys, and Wright called the home Toyhill.

It consists of two intersecting circles topped by mushroom-like concrete slab roofs. A mushroom-shaped carport echoes the shape of the house. Wright pulled in natural elements throughout the construction with his use of concrete, stone and oak wood detailing. The 2,164-square-foot house also boasts the architect’s signature central hearth and oak built-in furnishings, all of which remain in place today.",1948,6100eb253a671e6970209eaa

",Residence,Kaufmann House,modernist and international style,"One of the most important architects of the 20th Century, yet often overlooked, Richard Neutra has been on the forefront of modern residential architecture.  After moving to the United States from Vienna, Austria in 1923, Neutra worked with Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolf Schindler until 1930 when he started his own practice.  
One of Neutra’s several iconic projects is the Kaufmann House in Palm Springs, California. Completed between 1946-1947, the Kaufmann House was a vacation home for Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr. and his family to escape the harsh winters of the northeast.
The design of the house is quite simplistic; at the center of the house is the living room and the dining room that is the heart of the house and the family activity. The rest of the house branches out like a pinwheel in each of the cardinal directions.  From the center of the house each wing that branches out has its own specific function; however, the most important aspects of the house are oriented east/west while the supporting features are oriented north/south.
The house’s swimming pool is one of the most iconic and recognizable aspects of the Kaufmann House; however, it is not solely a photographic gem or simply a recreational feature.  The swimming pool creates a compositional balance of the overall design of the house.  The house alone is unbalanced and heavy as the wings are not equally proportioned, but with the addition and placement of the swimming pool there is a cohesive balance and harmony throughout the design.
The Kaufmann House has gone through several owners after the Kaufmann’s owned the house, which led to the house to fall in disrepair and a lack of concern and preservation of the modern dwelling.   However, a couple that appreciated 20th Century modern homes restored the house back to its original luster with the help of Julius Shulman. The Kaufmann House is now considered to be an architectural landmark and one of the most important houses in the 20th Century.",1947,6100eb253a671e6970209eb3

The forms are partially buried into the sloping ground of a national park and become a compositional addition to the landscape. Placed carefully as to not disrupt the pre-existing trees on the site, the structure responds to the adjacent ecosystem while the concrete forms address a more general nature through a playful manipulation of light. 
A wide set of stairs follows the sloping land into the enclosed exterior space and allows the light that penetrates through the canopy of trees into the sunken courtyard. This self-governing space represents the fold of nature that has been bound by the conditioned structures and become synthetic.
Separate from the original courtyard design, the space between the addition and the original mass allows nature to remove the forms from each other. A patch of grass weaves its way between the concrete structures, while the curved wall extends from the building to define the exterior space. Similar to the other boxes, a slice of the ceiling plane along the curved wall is removed to add that bit of complexity and ornamentation to the interior; however, the curved patterns of light greatly differ from the linear patterns in the former building.Four years after the original construction, Ando designed a new addition to the compound. Placed to the north of the existing structures, the new cave-like space rests within the upward sloping piece of land. The study features a bold curve in contradiction to the rectilinear organization, initiating a completely new rhythm.Narrow apertures have been punched through the façades adjacent to the exterior staircase and manipulate complex crossings of natural light and shadow into the interior spaces. The patterns provide the only amount of ornament to the simple rooms.

It was designed between 1974 and 1976 by the then relatively unknown architect Norman Foster (now Lord Foster). According to Chris Abel, the building exemplifies Foster's early work of ""a regular structure embracing all functions within a single, flexible enclosure, or 'universal space'"" where ""the design is all about allowing for change, internally and externally."" The Sainsbury Centre also demonstrates Foster's characteristic work methods of ""design development"", or ""integrated design"". It is situated on the western edge of the university's campus, beside the River Yare, and also houses the School of World Art Studies and Museology. Foster said of the building ""A building is only as good as its client and the architecture of the Sainsbury Centre is inseparable from the enlightenment and the driving force of the Sainsburys themselves and the support of the University of East Anglia.""
Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts by Norman Foster marked the style's transition from industrial to cultural buildings.
The building is a 135-metre-long, simple lattice steel structure that is glazed at both ends.
All of the building's functions were contained within a single, elongated hangar-like structure that contains a series of free-flowing spaces.

The building's main entrance on the ground floor, and a secondary entrance reached from an elevated walkway leading to a spiral staircase at first-floor level, both lead to a common area.
Alongside this reception space was the large ""living area"" – an open-plan area for displaying the art collection, which was divided by moveable partitions.
Foster Associates wanted the building to be a single, open shed-like structure, uncluttered by offices, stores and toilets.

To achieve this it envisioned a double skin supported by a lattice tubular-steel structure that was engineered by Antony Hunt, who was responsible for the structures of the majority of the early high-tech buildings.
Toilets, dark rooms, storage and all of the building's heating and ventilation systems were placed within the gap between the two skins. This meant that not only the internal spaces could be uncluttered, but also the internal and external surfaces of the walls could be free of adornment.
The structure was made from prefabricated tubal-steel elements, with the 74 columns delivered to site fully assembled, meaning that the frame could be assembled in only three weeks.

Externally the entire walls and roof were clad in the same factory-produced panel system – something that had never been done before. The 1.8 metres by 1.2 metres panels, which were standardised and interchangeable, were installed on a grid of neoprene gaskets that also worked as gutters.

While the majority of the building was clad with silver-coloured superplastic aluminium, which was ribbed for stiffness, louvred panels were used for airflow and glazed panels were placed around the School of Fine Arts common area and at the top of the building. Each panel was held in place with only six screws so they could easily be replaced.",1978,6100eb253a671e6970209ec7

With about 170,000m2 of gross floor area, the development will provide 1,040 apartment units of varying sizes with extensive outdoor spaces and landscaping. The site completes a green belt that stretches between Kent Ridge, Telok Blangah Hill and Mount Faber Parks.
Designed by Ole Scheeren, partner of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), The Interlace breaks away from Singapore’s standard typology of isolated, vertical apartment towers and instead explores a dramatically different approach to tropical living: an expansive interconnected network of living and communal spaces integrated with the natural environment. Thirty-one apartment blocks, each six-stories tall and identical in length, are stacked in a hexagonal arrangement to form eight large-scale open and permeable courtyards. The interlocking blocks form a vertical village with cascading sky gardens and both private and public roof terraces.
The design capitalizes on the generous size of the site and further maximizes the presence of nature by introducing extensive roof gardens, landscaped sky terraces and cascading balconies. Above- ground vehicular circulation is minimized, liberating large green areas within the development. The Interlace incorporates sustainability features through careful environmental analysis of sun, wind, and micro-climate conditions on site and the integration of low-impact passive energy strategies.
While maintaining the privacy of individual apartment units through the generous spacing of the building blocks and far-ranging views, the design also features communal spaces for shared activity. Extensive residential amenities and facilities are interwoven into the lush vegetation and offer opportunities for social interaction, leisure, and recreation.
Ole Scheeren said: “The design addresses concerns of shared space and social needs in a contemporary society and simultaneously responds to issues of shared living and individuality by offering a multiplicity of indoor/outdoor spaces specific to the tropical context.”
The name, The Interlace, reinforces the interconnectivity of the community with the surrounding natural environment. Ole Scheeren has created a new landmark for Singapore.",2013,6100eb253a671e6970209ed2

","Wind Point, USA",Brick,,residential,Wingspread,Prairie School,"One of the many houses designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the Wingspread also known as the Herbert F. Johnson House represents many of the key themes found in all architecture of Wright.
Designed for Herbert Johnson of the Johnson Wax Company, the house was built only a year before their renown corporate headquarters in Racine.
The basic layout of the house is centered around the core living room space, referred to as The Great Hall on the floorplans, with four wings extended forming zones for the family. These include the master's bedroom, children's rooms, kitchen and servants quarters and the guestrooms and garage.
The gigantic dome of the living room features a tall stone shaft that rises from the center, housing a total of five fireplaces. This massive chimney structure further separates the house, dividing the living room into four spaces; entrance, living room, dining room and library. 
Totaling fourteen thousand square feet of floor space, the house was monumental in it's time.
As in all of his work, the play of light within the Wingspread is remarkable. Opened up by rows and rows of skylights, the living room is flooded with natural light. Wright also incorporates views betewen levels, allowing family members to look down into the central spaces.
Flooring is constructed out of four foot concrete squares, which help moderate the temperature of the house through their use of radiant heating. The slight glossiness is achieved using none other than the homeowner's Johnson Wax which was specifically designed after the construction of this house and and the corporate headquarters.
To add a playful touch to the elegant and beautiful interior of Wingspread, Frank Lloyd Wright introduced a spiral staircase for the children that led up to a lookout (or belvedere) on the roof.
Upon completion of three-quarters of the house, Mrs. Johnson passed away which led to an increasing disinterest in the construction of the house for Mr. Johnson. Wright once said that upon experiencing life within the house that she had desired so much, Mr. Johnson was able to be rejuvinated and find himself again.
In an autobiography, Wright is quoted to have expressed complete satisfaction with the high level of quality and workmanship found in the home's woodwork and furniture. 
""Wingspread has the best brickwork I have seen in my life, and the materials of construction and the workmanship throughout are everywhere substantial.""",1937,6100eb253a671e6970209edf

Modern","Occupying the center of a small farming town in Finland, Säynätsalo’s Town Hall might appear almost too monumental for its context. Designed by Alvar Aalto in 1949, the town hall is a study in opposition: elements of classicism and the monumental blended with modernity and intimacy to form a cohesive new center-point for the community. These and other aspects of the design initially proved somewhat divisive, and the Town Hall has not been without controversy since its inception.
The town of Säynätsalo, located on a small island in central Finland’s Lake Päijänne, was first laid out in 1945. A few years later, the community organized an architectural competition to find a design for a town hall to complete their new municipality which was, by then, the home to around 3000 people. The civic complex was to comprise a council chamber, local government offices, a community library, staff apartments, and retail space that would ultimately allow the functions of the town hall to expand beyond their original parameters.
Aalto’s winning proposal for the project follows the traditional European court-and-tower model of a civic center. The complex consists of two wood-framed brick buildings: the rectangular library block and the U-shaped government building. These two buildings act as a retaining wall that allowed Aalto to fill the central courtyard with earth excavated from the slope of the site; thus, the courtyard is lifted one story above the surrounding landscape.
This difference in elevations creates two contrasting experiences of the building, depending on whether one is inside the courtyard or observing from outside. Inside the courtyard, the facades of the surrounding library and office spaces are only one story tall; however, outside observers instead see an imposing two-story facade, much of which is monolithic, unornamented brick. The two staircases leading up to the courtyard from ground level are likewise divergent in style. The eastern staircase is formal and rectilinear, with two flights carved from impeccably hewn granite. The western staircase has a more irregular footprint, and is made not of stone or brick but of terraced sod held back by wooden planks.
The courtyard itself is only partially paved, continuing the juxtaposition of brick and grass begun by the two staircases. The entrances to the civic offices and the public library open onto the courtyard, allowing it to serve not only as an open circulatory space, but also as a public plaza for the benefit of the entire town. The sense of public accessibility is heightened by the extensive glazing of the entrance lobby and corridor lining two sides of the courtyard. The permeability of these spaces makes for a stark contrast with the most prominent feature of the town hall: the council chamber.
Directly across from the glazed corridor, branching off the equally bright and airy entrance hall, is a darker more narrow stairwell lined with brick. This staircase, which leads to the council chamber, turns back on itself at a landing halfway up, shielding the chamber from view of the lobby; the stairwell is also hidden from exterior view thanks to its east-facing clerestory windows.
Entry into the council chamber brings one into space of a much grander scale than that of the stairway leading to it. The room is roughly cubic, with the distance from floor to ceiling nearly matching the length of the walls. The ceiling, whose slope matches that of the roof, is visibly supported by wooden struts fanning out from two central beams; these struts support the roof entirely, negating the need for heavy built-in framing that would obstruct ventilation between the interior and exterior surfaces of the roof. The council chamber is naturally lit by a densely-louvered west-facing window, with hanging lamps illuminating both the desks below and the wooden trusses above them.
It was the council chamber that provoked the most controversy when Aalto proposed his design to the people of Säynätsalo. The municipal board members in charge of the building were unconvinced that a town as small as theirs could justify the construction of a 17-meter tall council chamber, especially given the high price of the brick specified for the project. Aalto, however, reportedly replied “Gentlemen! The world’s most beautiful and most famous town hall, that of Siena, has a council chamber 16 meters high. I propose we build one that is 17 meters.”
Aalto’s appeal to the board members wasn’t the only aspect of his project that made reference to historical precedents. Despite its Modernist aesthetic, Säynätsalo Town Hall has been heavily influenced by Renaissance and Medieval Italian architecture. The tower does not only allude to its counterpart in Siena; combined with the courtyard arrangement below, but also antecedents like Piazza San Marco in Venice, as well. The library and civic programs facing onto a central square mirror a similar arrangement in the Piazza Vecchia of Bergamo. Smaller details also owe their inspiration to Italy: the terraced earthen stairs to the plaza are also based on an Italian model.",1949,6100eb253a671e6970209eaf

Retail",Jewel Changi Airport,Neo-futurism,"Fulfilling its mission as a connector between the existing terminals, Jewel combines two environments—an intense marketplace and a paradise garden—to create a new community-centric typology as the heart, and soul, of Changi Airport. Jewel weaves together an experience of being in nature with culture and leisure facilities, dramatically asserting the idea of the airport as an uplifting and vibrant urban center, and echoing  Singapore's reputation as “the City in the Garden.” 
The publicly accessible 135,700 sqm center includes facilities for landside airport operations, indoor gardens and leisure attractions, retail offerings, restaurants and cafes, and hotel facilities, all under one roof. Directly connected to Terminal 1 and to Terminals 2 and 3 via pedestrian bridges, Jewel engages both in-transit passengers as well as the public at large. Each of the cardinal axes—north, south, east, and west—are reinforced by gateway gardens that orient the visitors and offer visual connections between the internal program elements of Jewel and the other airport terminals.
At the heart of Jewel is the Forest Valley, a terraced indoor garden that offers many spatial and interactive experiences featuring walking trails, cascading waterfalls, and quiet seating areas. Amid the more than 200 different species of trees and flora, is the world’s tallest indoor waterfall —a ‘rain vortex’—showering down from an oculus in the domed roof to the Forest Valley garden seven stories below. The waterfall—at peak conditions flowing at more than 10,000 gallons per minute—aids in the cooling of the landscape environment and collects significant rainwater to be re-used in an around the building. Surrounding the gardens is a multi-level retail marketplace on five levels that access the garden via a series of vertical canyons.
The geometry of Jewel is based on a semi-inverted toroidal dome roof. Measuring 200 meters across at the longest span, and supported only intermittently along the rim of the garden, the integrated structure, and the façade system allows for a near column-free interior. Achieving a level of comfort for the diversity of activities, as well as to sustain the vast array of plant life within adequate sunlight, required an integrated system of glazing, static and dynamic shading, and an innovative and efficient displacement ventilation system. Jewel is slated to receive Singapore's GreenMark Platinum status.
On the fifth level is the Canopy Park, which includes 14,000 sqm of attractions integrated within the garden spaces. These include net structures suspended within the trees, a suspended catenary glass-bottom bridge walk, a planted hedge maze, and mirror maze, and feature installations completed in collaboration with internationally acclaimed artists. Additional features include a topiary walk, horticultural displays, and an event plaza for 1,000 people. With Jewel, the airport has become a destination in its own right.",2019,6100eb253a671e6970209eb1
